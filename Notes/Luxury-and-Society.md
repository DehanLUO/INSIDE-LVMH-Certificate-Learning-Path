### Past, Present and Future: The Luxury Formula
What makes a luxury brand *relevant over time*?

In this video, **Serge Carreira from Sciences Po Paris**, Lecturer in the Master's program “*New Luxury and Art de Vivre*” at Sciences Po Paris, focuses on one of luxury's most singular dimensions: **Time**.

**Luxury has to be of our time and timeless at the same time.** *Serge Carreira*

He uncovers how luxury can evolve with society to ensure its values are lasting. 

#### PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE: THE LUXURY FORMULA
I am Serge Carreira, lecturer in the program of the Master New Luxury and Art de Vivre of Science Po in Paris.

Luxury is a magic world. Everyone has a view on what luxury is or not. Some will describe it as a feeling. Others will consider an object or an experiment. It will be too restrictive to define luxury as only what is not needed. As a matter of fact, it is a cultural expression beyond immediate needs.

Luxury is defined through a combination of various elements: the quality, the identity, the use, the price, the desire, the scarcity... We will focus on one of its most singular dimension: Time.

The fact is that the idea of luxury combines individual and social representation. It generates a temporal mutability of luxury. Luxury is a quest for perfection, an appreciation of knowhow and culture, and an aesthetic vision.

If luxury **evolves with society**, its values are lasting. There is a kind of paradox in this: it has to be of our times and timeless at the same time.

##### Luxury & the Past
"There is no past we can bring back by longing for it, there is only an eternal now that builds and creates out of the past something new and better," says Goethe.

Luxury is rooted in the past, but it should not be nostalgia. "Past means **heritage**". A luxury product has a history. The vocabulary of luxury includes
- Crafts
- Myths
- Icons
- Excellence
However, if luxury does not evolve, it could become dusty and "old".

##### Luxury Brands *in The Present*
What makes the brand relevant? How does it resonate nowadays?

"Beauty in things exists merely in the mind which contemplates them," states David Hume. The eye changes. And then luxury changes. Luxury expresses a desire to beautify life. It could be considered as the pursuit of an absolute beauty. It is something "extra ordinary", which means something not common. It has a dreamy touch. **Aesthetic** is a major element to turn luxury attractive.

However, luxury is a business of offer, not a business of demand. That is why it could be sometimes pushing the boundaries. Despite its strong roots in the past, luxury is a game changer.

In order to be in a constant attraction relationship, it has to reflect today's customers' expectations:
- Authenticity
- Transparency
- Sustainability
- Inclusivity
These values are at the core of the luxury concept.

"Lasting" is one of the characteristics of luxury. It juxtaposes the different temporal dimensions.

##### The Future *of Luxury*
It does not mean luxury has to be futuristic. Nevertheless, what makes it so special is the fact that it remains always relevant despite trends. The Craft, the Myth, and the Design make a luxury **product durable**. It brings also a personal emotion. As it is a meaningful object, a bag, a ring, a scarf, or a watch can be transmitted from one generation to another one. Moreover, by essence, luxury embodies hold and perennial values:
- Quality Beyond Aesthetic;
- Legacy Beyond Desire;
- Emotion beyond Ownership;
- Creativity beyond trends.

### Brands and Society
From products to purpose: the focus on values

**What emotions and societal values are strongly associated with brands, and in line with society's aspirations?**

Research has shown that consumers rely on luxury consumption to communicate certain values, and thus **reward companies** that truly reflect those values.

Follow Anne Michaut, Marketing Professor at **HEC Paris**, as she uncovers **the role of brands in society** related to their opportunities to express functional, experiential and symbolic values.

##### From product to purpose the focus on values

I am Anne Michaut, Marketing Professor at HEC Paris. In this video, we are going to talk about the importance of conveying values for luxury brands today. Let us explore why commitment towards society has become prominent for luxury brands, and how these brands are evolving in response to changing clients' expectations and societal demands.

The luxury industry is undergoing a continuous transformation. No longer is it sufficient for brands to simply create extraordinary products. No longer is it sufficient to accompany these products with extraordinary brands, or to make customers live extraordinary experiences. Luxury must now demonstrate purpose, values and social responsibility. This shift represents both a challenge and an opportunity for these brands to redefine their role in society.

Our discussion will focus on three key areas.
- the evolution of customer preferences, from owning products to embodying values.
- how luxury consumption reflect extended self and personal identity.
- the necessity to transition from extraordinary products to meaningful values.

###### From owning products TO EMBODYING VALUES
Research demonstrates a significant shift in consumer perspectives. In 2013, nearly 44% of customers believed corporations should take a social stance. Ten years later, this number had surged to 88%. This evolution proves particularly significant for two reasons. First, it demonstrates not just growth, but a fundamental reversal in consumer expectations, from social responsibility being a minority preference to an overwhelming majority demand. Second, the rapid pace of this change suggests an urgency for brands to adapt.

The shift signals a complete transformation in how society views the role of corporations, especially in the luxury sector, where Brand values and customer identity are closely intertwined. The data suggests purpose-driven consumption has evolved from a *niche preference* to a *mainstream expectation*. As mentioned before, this transformation presents both a challenge and opportunity for luxury brands that have traditionally focused on product excellence and exclusivity.

The new mandate is twofold:
- To embody **exceptional values** that resonate with **conscious consumers**.
- To demonstrate **tangible, meaningful implementation** of these values.
The traditional strengths of luxury brands, attention to detail, commitment to excellence, positions them uniquely to lend this evolution, provided they can successfully translate these capabilities from product creation to value creation and a societal impact.

###### Extend Self AND PERSONAL IDENTITY
The relationship between luxury and identity has evolved beyond simple status signaling. Luxury consumption is strongly associated with the extended self. Consumers use luxury brands to acquire, create, preserve and reinforce their identities, and luxury brands serve as *instruments of identity expression* and *personal narrative constructions*.

Through two key mechanisms. The first one centres on the facet of materialism and societal meaning of consumption. Possessions reflect *characteristics of their owners* within society, serving as *visible markers* of personal values and aspirations. Recent findings showed the same effect in the case of experiences. This goes deeper than traditional conspicuous consumption. It is about using brands as tools to communicate one's worldview and ethical stance. When customers choose a brand, they are not just buying a product; they are making a statement about their values and position in society.

The second mechanism focuses on self-congruity, the alignment between brand and personal identity. Consumers actively seek brands whose image matches their self-concept or aspirational self-image. They make *purchasing decisions* based on the perceived *congruency* between their *individual identity* and *brand values*, and consumers assess the capacity of brands to help them communicate on their own identity.

###### From extraordinary products to MEANINGFUL VALUES
In this dynamic, luxury consumption moves away from a *simple transaction* into an *instrument for identity equation and expression*. Brands become aspirational vehicles, reflecting consumers' existing identities, as well as instruments that help them construct their desired identities. This evolution requires luxury brands to transform from *craftsmen of products* to *architects of content*.

Success demands delivering not just exceptional products but authentic narratives backed by concrete actions that consumers can incorporate into their identity expression and adopt as part of their extended self. Brands must evolve to enable transforming consumption into a meaningful expression of individual and collective identity.
- The **future of luxury** goes **beyond ownership**, emphasizing **meaningful value** and **deep consumer connections**.
The future of luxury transcends ownership. It is about representing meaningful values and creating profound connections that resonates with consumers' social consciousness. This requires multiple transformations, such as establishing **transparent supply chains**, demonstrating verifiable **environmental and social commitments**, and developing economic value through sustainable practices.
- Brands must ensure **transparency in supply chains**, demonstrate **social and environmental commitments** and **integrate sustainability** into their economic models.

##### Redefining the Status Quo on Sustainability Issues

In this video, **Anne Michaut**, Marketing Professor at **HEC Paris**, shares her definition of **sustainability**, and uncovers how businesses not only focus on minimizing their negative impact, but also **seek to effect a positive one**.

**Sustainability and sustainable development are defined as the ability to meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.** *The Brundtland Commission*

I am Anne Michaut, Marketing professor at HEC Paris. In this video we are going to intend to redefine the status quo on sustainability.

The concept of sustainability has gained increasing attention in recent decades. But it has also become a buzzword, often misused or overgeneralized. As its core, sustainability and sustainable development are defined as the ability to *meet present* needs without compromising the ability of *future generations* to *meet their own*. This foundational definition, introduced by the Brundtland Commission, emphasizes long-term persistence and remains the most widely cited interpretation of sustainability. Another prevalent perspective frames sustainability through its three pillars:
- Environments
- Economic
- Social systems
Each requiring simultaneous optimization.

###### Business Case FOR SUSTAINABILITY
This perspective encourages companies to re-examine their activities across the supply chain, aiming to minimize *negative impacts* while maximizing *positive outcomes*. Pressuring sustainability can provide multiple benefits. First, companies recognize the potential for upside benefits, including increased revenues, reduced operational costs, and lower risks. Second, efforts to cut waste and reduce resource consumption can directly improve profitability. Finally, adopting a values-based approach can attract top talents, enhance brand reputation, and build trust with customers and stakeholders.

Research underscores several compelling dimensions of corporate responsibility towards sustainability. First, there is a moral obligation for companies to engage in sustainability. This means businesses have a duty to operate in ways that respect and protects the planet, its resources and its people. Acting as responsible stewards of shared ecosystems. Second, sustainability is deeply tied to the concept of the "license to operate." Companies, beyond serving their customers, required tacit or explicit permission from governments, communities, and stakeholders to function effectively. Operating sustainably strengthens this social contract, ensuring that businesses contribute positively to the societies and environments. Third, there is a strong reputational advantage to sustainability. Companies that embrace meaningful sustainability initiatives enhance their brand image, boost employee morale, and increase trust among consumers and stakeholders, which can translate into tangible benefits such as increased market value and stronger customer loyalty.

###### A Holistic Vision: FROM SUSTAINABILITY TO ENGAGEMENT
Advocates often emphasize the importance of *aligning corporate actions* with the *business activities*. Illustrating this, Guerlain has a longstanding commitment to bee conservation. Reflecting the bee's emblematic significance to the brand. The "Guerlain for Bees Conservation Program" addresses supply chain issues: protecting the precious honey production of black bees. But Guerlain's engagement goes further with socially impact programs related to their deep commitment to bees.

Brands are increasingly adopting a broader perspective on their responsibilities, embracing a *holistic vision* of their role in the sustainability in society rather than *focusing solely on the business* they operate. While efforts to enhance activities through
- More **sustainable products**
- Innovative **packaging**
- Improved **traceability**
- Reduced **carbon footprints**
- **Circular economy** initiatives
remain central to grand commitments, it is equally essential to consider the broader environmental and social impacts of their operations.

A truly forward-thinking approach integrates these tangible efforts with a deeper commitment to fostering positive societal change and addressing systemic environmental challenges. Historically, companies that were overly product-focused, failed to respond to customers' evolving expectations. In today's context, businesses must extend this principle to society at large. Beyond merely really meeting consumer demands, companies must *manage society's expectation*, engaging with non-customers, communities, and broader stakeholders to *gain acceptance and trust*. It is not about framing business and society as being in tension but about recognizing their interdependence. Companies thrive when societies thrives, and acknowledging this interconnectedness is critical to long-term success.

In conclusion, the responsibility of companies toward sustainability must be envisioned with a **broad scope**. Brands should **move beyond transactional sustainability initiatives** to embrace **deeper engagement and commitment** toward **societal well-being**. By adopting a truly **holistic vision**, businesses can **redefine their role** by moving **from sustainability** of their operations as participants in the economy, to engagement and **commitment** towards society as key contributors to a future for all.

##### Equity, Diversity, Inclusion
**What are the definitions of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion?**

**Felicia Henderson**, Lecturer at **Sciences Po Paris**, gives a brief overview of equity, diversity, and inclusion in organizations and offers some suggestions on how you can **foster Equity and Inclusion** in workplaces.

Hello. My name is Felicia Henderson and I am a lecturer at Science Po Paris, where my main course focuses on corporate governance. I have also taught Comparative Equality Law, introduction to Organizational Behavior, and a course on inequality and social change.

In this talk, I give a brief overview of equity, diversity and inclusion in organizations, and offer some suggestions for how you can foster equity and inclusion in your workplace or future workplace. First, I will define the concepts "equity", "diversity", and "inclusion". You have perhaps heard the three words together, or the acronym EDI or DEI, but each term has a distinct meaning.

**Diversity** refers to demographic difference or the ways that people differ from each other. We speak about identity characteristics or dimensions of diversity. Race, ethnicity and gender are common in discussions of diversity, but there are only a few of the characteristics that distinguish one person or group from another. Other dimensions of diversity include religion, sexual orientation, age, national origin, physical ability socioeconomic status, and many others as shown here.

|                              |                                |                            |                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Race                         | Age                            | First language             | Education                      |
| Ethnicity                    | National origin                | Immigration status         | Geographic location            |
| Gender & gender identity     | Income & socio-economic status | Veteran status             | Professional experience        |
| Religion & spiritual beliefs | Physical & mental ability      | Marital or parental status | Position, title or function    |
| Sexual orientation           | Colour                         | Physical appearance        | Seniority or management status |

While diversity looks at numbers, inclusion looks at an organization's culture and climate. In an **inclusive workplace**, all individuals feel welcomed, respected, and valued; no employee's identity characteristics create an advantage or disadvantage to that person's feeling safe to be who they are and enjoying a sense of belonging, support, and empowerment.

Finally, equity is about fairness based on an individuals' varying life experiences. It is not "equality" if we limit equality to mean identical treatment. Instead, **equity** means creating fair access, opportunity, and advancement for all, which requires identifying and removing barriers that exist for summit demographic groups and reforming policies, processes, and procedures that perpetuate unequal outcomes.

These concepts help us understand the array of challenges and solutions related to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

###### Why Do EDI *Matter In Business*?
Now, let us understand why they matter in business and why they should matter to you... Regardless of your identity characteristics.

First, promoting greater EDI is simply the right thing to do. The emotional and psychological benefits, particularly for employees who face discrimination or hostility in the broader society, convince many organizations to promote inclusive workplaces, representative leadership, and equitable processes as a moral imperative.

Additionally, research increasingly demonstrates that prioritizing EDI is a business imperative. It is the smart thing to do. Tangible benefits include attracting and retaining talent, boosting creativity and innovation, making better decisions, and improving financial performance.

A few statistics: In one study, companies with **diverse leadership** were more likely to achieve above-average profitability, 25% more likely for the most gender-diverse executive teams, and 36% more for the most ethnically and culturally diverse executive teams. In another study, where employees believe the organization is committed to diversity and feel included, reported performance improvements included a 31% increase in responsiveness to evolving customer needs, a 42% increase in team collaboration, and an 83% increase in ability to innovate.

Despite proven benefits, equity diversity and inclusion remain underdeveloped in business. In addition to systemic challenges, a major individual-level obstacle is bias and stereotypes.

###### What Explains these Biases and Stereotypes?
It is well-established in social psychology that we prefer people who are similar to us, a phenomenon known as in-group bias. Conversely, we tend to view dissimilar people unfavourably, known as out-group bias. The dimensions of diversity I discussed earlier are often used to define be in-group and out-group.

Another consequence of this categorization is out-group homogeneity. Rather than evaluating out-group members as individuals, we harbour stereotypes that assign the same negative qualities to all people who share an identity characteristic, like gender - "all women" - or ethnicity -"all Black people" - or physical appearance - "all overweight people".

Out-group bias and stereotypes often operate at the unconscious level, but have profound impacts on the way we evaluate and interact with other people. They can thwart efforts to hire and promote demographically different people and even organizations that achieve workforce diversity often fail at inclusion.

A Harvard Business Review article reminds us that:"Increasing diversity does not, by itself, increase effectiveness; what matters is how an organization harnesses diversity."

###### How Can You Help *Your Organization to Harness EDI*?
So, I will close by explaining how you can help your organization harness diversity in a way that promotes greater inclusion and, consequently, better performance.

**Being aware** that out-group bias exists and we are all prone to it is an important step. As with all cognitive biases, the more aware we are, the better we are able to recognize and challenge our own assumptions.

**Being open** to difference and learning helps counteract exclusion. One of the quotes I live by is "everyone is not you". Our perspectives are shaped by our unique identities and experiences. When we are open to multiple perspectives, we are better able to exchange ideas and information and learn collectively.

Finally, when you *observe* inequity or exclusion, you can act as an ally. Allyship refers to behaviors ranging from interacting more intentionally with underrepresented individuals to consciously supporting such employees by amplifying their voices, highlighting their contributions, and recommending them for visible opportunities.

Advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion is hard work, and progress requires all of us to share in the work. I have provided a few resources for you and wish you good courage on your personal EDI journey.

### LIFE 360
#### LVMH's environmental commitments
#### LVMH's ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
LVMH sees environmental protection as **more than a responsibility**: it is an **imperative**!

Discover LVMH's commitments to the environment with **Hélène Valade, Group Environment Development Director**.

I am Hélène Valade, in charge of the Environmental Strategy at LVMH at group level. I am very happy to have this opportunity to talk to you about sustainability.

I suppose that no matter what country you work in, you can see problems with the environment, whether it is biodiversity or climate. We live on a planet whose natural resources are being depleted due to global warming, climate change.

These issues concern and impact LVMH. Why? Because all our products come from **nature**. No champagne without grapes, no perfumes without flowers or plants, no dresses without cotton or silk.

But we can do something. We are taking action to Life 360, our new environmental strategy.

> LIFE: LVMH Initiatives For the Environment
> 360: Setting targets for 2023, 2026 & 2030
> The priority of LIFE 360 is to create products the forge a **fresh alliance between LVMH and nature**, and which make a positive contribution to **fighting climate change** and **preserving biodiversity**. Let us discover more details on the LVMH environmental strategy.

##### What is *LIFE 360*
Life 360 is composed of four concrete action plans on circular economy, biodiversity, traceability and transparency, climate, with objectives to be reached in 2030, 2026 and 2030.

##### Creative *Circularity*
Our first action plan is about circular economy. Our objective is to reduce the environmental footprint of our products. How? With
- Eco Design Products
- New Innovative Raw Materials
- Recycled Fibres
- Products with a Second Life
- Repair Services
- New Services like Nona Source that resells new fabrics.

Our aim is to disrupt code of beauty, to make the sustainable desirable.

##### Biodiversity
The second action plan is about biodiversity.  Our objective is to limit our impact on biodiversity. We exclude, for example, products that come from regions at high risk of deforestation or water stress.

But we have also the objective to have a positive impact, giving back to nature what we borrow from it. We have an ambitious objective of *rehabilitating* five million hectares in fauna and flora habitat by 2030. To do that, we are focusing on regenerative agriculture. That is new agricultural practices having the potential to reverse biodiversity loss.

##### Traceability *and Transparency*
The third action plan is about traceability and transparency. Our objective is to guarantee a perfect traceability from the field to the stores. We need to know countries from which our raw materials are sourced, and we need to ensure that social, ethical, environmental principles have been respected throughout supply chains.

That is why in Life 360, we have this target of 100% of our strategic supply chains being certified at exacting standards by 2030.

##### Climate
The last action plan is, of course, about climate. Our objective is to limit our carbon footprint with lighter packaging, more renewable energy, more road and sea transport.

We are committed to *reduce CO2* emissions from energy consumption at our sites and stores by 50% by 2026. We are also committed to reduce CO2 emissions from Scope 3, that is from transport and raw materials by 55% by 2030.

> LVMH wishes to amplify its efforts by **mobilizing its stakeholders** and first among them its **employees**, who are encouraged to **actively drive change**. For this purpose, their environmental skills will be reinforced through **training programs** designed for their business and professions, notably offered by the Group's LIFE Academy.

##### Conclusion
We are the leader in luxury sector. We must also be lead in environmental issues. The high quality of our products is also a high environmental quality. Our capacity to influence our suppliers our clients is very strong. It must be put to the service of the planet.

### Creative Circularity
#### At Ruinart, sustainable development is a source of creative inspiration
Since its foundation in 1729, Ruinart has been a symbol of French art de vivre. The Maison has crafted its exceptional wines by **nurturing the roots of the terroir** and ancestral savoir-faire. In the vineyards located in the Montagne de Reims, the cellar masters have witnessed the impact of **climate change**. In 1961, the first day of harvest was October 6. In 2020, the first day of harvest was August 17. Global warming is a reality and it is changing the way Ruinart chooses its grapes and creates its champagne. One of the major challenges in the coming decades will be to **mitigate and adapt to climate change**.

In order to harvest perfect grapes, Ruinart has been deepening its commitment to **preserving the soils** that are a source of life. Because the preservation of biodiversity is a top priority, Ruinart has announced that the Maison is dedicating the entire 40 hectares of the historic Taissy vineyard to a **biodiversity pilot project** carried out with Reforest’Action. It attests to the drive to develop this approach in the years to come and to share it more widely on the scale of the Champagne region.

Faithful to its pioneering spirit, Ruinart also promotes **sustainable energy**, like choosing LED lighting in its cellars. And in terms of commercial transport, **85% of deliveries are made by sea** and 15% by road – not by plane.

With its **Second Skin packaging launch**, Ruinart reinforces its commitment to promoting **sustainable innovation**

One of the first reasons to buy champagne is to give it as a gift; therefore, packaging is essential. Since 2015, gift boxes have been eco-conceived, but Ruinart has pushed its limits by challenging its design and development teams to create the second skin case. Two years of research and development were needed to develop **this sustainable packaging** in every aspect, from bottle shape to wine protection. This **100% recyclable paper case** reduces the bottle’s packaging carbon footprint by 60%. Its white colour and texture are inspired by the Maison’s historical Crayères, the chalk quarries that store Ruinart Cuvées in optimal conditions.

​Maison Ruinart strives to create a more sustainable French art de vivre and **conscious luxury at all levels**.

##### Sustainable development driving creative inspiration by Ruinart
Since 1729, the first ever established champagne house has looked to preserve its ancestral savoir-faire and carefully cultivate the soil its exceptional wines are rooted in. In light of the ever growing environmental challenges, maison Ruinart, entering its 4th century of existence, takes a decisive step forward in its commitment to the preservation of living soils and the transmission of know-how, art and culture.

Beyond necessity, sustainability is a source of innovation and a driving force of creativity for Ruinart. Today, building on 2 years of research and development, the champagne house takes an unprecedented action, a 100% paper case, entirely recyclable and moulded to the shape of the bottle, that reduces the bottle's packaging carbon footprint by 60%.

Its colour and texture are inspired by the maison's historical Crayeres, this case highlights the iconic silhouette and echoes the roundness of its wines, while preserving the taste integrity.

In this continuous effort to bring together aesthetics, authenticity and goodness, maison Ruinart strives to craft, at all levels, a more sustainable French "art de vivre" and conscious luxury.

#### The partnership between Christian Dior and Parley for the Oceans​
**Discover how creative circularity is transforming the creative process of Maison Christian Dior Couture.**

Nature has always held a special place in the hearts of Christian Dior and his successors, who have in turn celebrated the beauty of gardens and flowers in their collections. Perpetuating this deep admiration, the House of Dior today works as a creative laboratory in motion to integrate Sustainable Development into all the Maison’s professional sectors and areas of expertise, organized around three pillars:
- the protection of natural resources​
- the contribution to the climate effort​
- the daily commitment on the part of all the House's collaborators​

The encounter between Dior and Parley for the Oceans is a continuation of these virtuous actions, placed under the signs of sharing, transmission and determination to build a better future. For the second year in a row, Kim Jones, Artistic Director of Dior’s men's lines, has teamed up with this environmental organization that takes action against major ocean threats – with the Parley AIR (Avoid, Intercept, Redesign) strategy. Together, they have conceived a Beach Capsule made of 96% recycled fabrics, reflecting the Maison's objective to move towards a more sustainable fashion, thanks to the concept of circularity.

Driven by eco-innovation, in 2019 the two partners initiated joint research work, which gave life to novel materials made from **Parley Ocean Plastic®** – created with marine plastic debris and fishing nets recovered from the coastlines of several countries and islands around the world, then reworked in **Dior’s Ateliers**. A challenge for the artisans who, using this recycled fibre as an alternative to virgin polyester, created high quality fabrics, such as seersucker, silky knit and a technical fabric punctuated with the Dior Oblique motif.

Fusing durability and desirability, the wardrobe designed for this unique capsule is the fruit of a new alliance, inviting us to rethink the fashion of tomorrow by transforming the creative process.

Kim grew up in different countries around the world. For him, it is very important to give back something to nature.

We wanted to work with an NGO, Parley for the Oceans. A big part of what we do is to intercept plastic from nature, to turn it into new products. It is the first time that a knit has been created with Ocean Plastic thread. Obtaining a uniform palette was a challenge.

This is silk polyester. This is a piece that 100 percent  made out of Ocean Plastic. There is 60 percent plastic from the sea.

I think the old idea of everything has to be perfect right away is wrong. It is all about changing a culture, and that takes time.

There is a weaving technique called chine where we dye each thread one at a time. Then we do a weaving sequence that allows us to work on the pattern in depth. I believe that fashion has the role, to turn everything upside down.

#### Nona Source, a veritable innovation in sourcing
Created by three experts from the LVMH Group – Marie Falguera, Romain Brabo, and Anne Prieur du Perray, Nona Source is a **startup incubated by our DARE intrapreneurial program** (Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur) to accelerate innovative solutions.

With their expertise in material sourcing and digital transformation, they designed a game-changing platform to **re-use deadstocks, the “sleeping beauties”** stored in the warehouses of exclusive LVMH Fashion & Leather Goods Maisons.

I am Marie Falguera. I am Romain Brabo. Anne Prieur du Perray. Intrapreneurs at Nona Source!

I was watching the warehousing of what we call "sleeping beauties" at Nona Source. I wanted to wake them up so I thought about a way we could collect them, evaluate them, unlock their value and make them available via a platform.

Nona Source is a platform where young designers can find exceptional materials that we have selected from LMVH Maisons at very competitive prices.

We really want to revolutionize sourcing, and we know very well that the search for materials is an extremely sensory experience for young designers. So we worked a lot on the "touch & feel" experience to get a digital replication that is as beautiful as possible, working on the photos, videos and detailed descriptions of the materials.

One of the key challenges for Nona Source is the ability to digitalize purchasing and sourcing of fabrics. When our designers visit the website it is really important that they be able to quickly find fabrics that interest them and then, once they go to the product description, they find all the information they need to decide whether to buy it, without being able to touch it.

Today we bought some incredible inventory from an LVMH Maison in France, about 150,000 metres, enough to make around 75,000 clothing pieces and support a hundred young designers and young brands.

We have established good relationships based on confidence with the warehouse and with transport partners, which is vital, because if this is going to be a sustainable initiative you need solid long-term relationships.

Nona Source is not something that was incubated all by itself. It is a startup that has great support, coached by the LVMH intrapreneurship program. This lets us have impact and really drive change.

The future for Nona is to become an innovative circular platform committed to more ethical fashion. And become the sourcing solution of choice among young designers across Europe. With no waste!

This is a huge issue too for future generations, and when you are a mother you feel a sense of pride in telling your children you worked on this type of project.

### Biodiversity
#### Fundamental importance of preserving the ecosystem
LVMH has been committed to making **the protection of biodiversity an absolute priority**.

Protecting **nature’s ecosystems** has always been of utmost importance to LVMH, whose activity is significantly reliant on **natural raw materials** (flowers, grapes, cotton, leather, stones etc.). Therefore, LVMH is taking action and making the protection and regeneration of biodiversity a key pillar of its LIFE 360 environmental strategy.

**Alexandre Capelli** is the Innovation & Biodiversity Director at **LVMH** and leads **the environmental creativity and innovation topics linked to products and raw materials within the Group**. Let us discover with him how LVMH has structured its strategy around three main objectives to preserve and regenerate biodiversity.

I am Alexandre Capelli, I joined the Group 15 years ago, always focusing on environment. Today I am the LVMH Environment Deputy Director and with the LVMH environment team, we are implementing our new LVMH environmental LIFE 360 strategy based upon 4 main pillars:
- Creative circularity
- Traceability and transparency
- Climate
- Biodiversity.
Within this strategy, I am leading the environmental creativity and innovation topics linked to products and raw materials. As illustration, I like to mention the maison program dedicated to regenerative luxury that we conduct with Central Saint Martins in London. I am also leading the biodiversity topics.

##### Our Commitments *to Biodiversity*
What does it mean biodiversity for LVMH? It means both dependencies and impacts. Firstly dependencies: LVMH had an intimate relationship with the richness and beauty of life, which gave the products of our Maisons their exceptional character. I could mention cotton, grapes, flowers, wool, leather... All our Maisons rely on biodiversity. Secondly impacts: our activities are generating some impacts on nature as wastewater, deforestation or the use of natural resources. The aim is to reduce this impact.

The protection of natural ecosystems is therefore an imperative for LVMH. We are taking actions and making the protection and regeneration of biodiversity a key pillar of our LIFE 360 environmental strategy. The LVMH Group has structured its biodiversity strategy around 3 main objectives:
1. Establish a clear and precise measurement of biodiversity impact
	Measurement is a potent tool to define priorities, objectives and actions; it remains a complex issue where biodiversity is concerned. LVMH works on the deployment and improvement of measurement tools. LVMH also participates by way of its commitments and actions in the frame of reference defined by Science Based Targets for Nature whose aim is to align the actions of business with international objectives for the preservation of biodiversity.
2. Avoid and reduce impact on ecosystems
	By 2026 LVMH will roll out certification systems corresponding to the most rigorous standards of biodiversity-related criteria and apply them right across its strategic supply network, covering 100% of its supply. In addition, LVMH has set a target of zero deforestation by 2035 across its supply chain.
3. Regenerate and preserve ecosystems
	The objective is to regenerate or preserve the equivalent of 5 million hectares of habitat for flora, by 2030, using two main levers. First: implementing regenerative agriculture within our supply chain covering all strategic supplies as grapes, cotton, wool, leather or palm oil. Second: supporting projects outside LVMH supply chain to regenerate or preserve endangered ecosystems.

In 2022, we already have positive and concrete outcomes: with regard to raw material certifications, Maisons are achieving a great performance: as illustration, 71% of the cotton, 94% of grapes and 91% of leather are *certified*. About the 5 million hectares of ecosystem preserved or regenerated, we already achieved 1.37 million hectares by implementing different programs across the world. I can mention some of them as: the UNESCO Man And Biosphere and LVMH program dedicated to the Amazon where we are supporting local actions to fight deforestation, I can also mention a program launched around the Lake Chad in Africa with the Circular BioEconomy Alliance supported by King Charles that aims at developing sustainable cotton production in a regenerative agroforestry system.

Our future challenges are deeply linked to our ability to achieve a *full traceability* of our supply chains. It will allow us to help both suppliers and farmers to transition through regenerative practices. The target is to cover all our strategic raw material by 2030. We need to accelerate and scale up already existing pilot projects. Another challenge that we will face in 2023 and 2024 is to define a science based target of reduction of our impact on Nature as we already have for climate. A complex exercise for which LVMH aims to be a leading company.

##### Key *Takeaways*
To conclude, you understand that environment and more specifically biodiversity topics, are key challenges for the Group. They are complex but really interesting as they involved many different dimensions. Whatever you role in a brand, you can be an active actor of change to help LVMH Maisons to preserve nature resources.

If you want to get more actively involved in the environmental topics, my advice would be to have at least a basic scientific background. So now, be the change!

#### Regenerating soils with Moët Hennessy
As a global leader in luxury Wines and Spirits, Moët Hennessy division has a special responsibility towards its stakeholders and the planet, from soils to communities.

Learn from **Sandrine Sommer**, Chief Sustainability Officer at **Moët Hennessy, about the Living Soils Living Together** sustainability program, especially its first pillar about **REGENERATING SOILS**.

I am Sandrine Sommer. I am Chief Sustainability Officer at Moët Hennessy, the Wines and Spirits Division of LVMH, since 2020. As an engineer in packaging, I joined LVMH in the packaging and development department, at first Moët & Chandon, then Make Up For Ever, and Guerlain. Few years later, at Guerlain, I was given the opportunity to lead the Sustainability. Since then I continued in this field.

As a global leader in Luxury Wines and Spirits with so many iconic Maisons, Moët Hennessy has a special responsibility towards its stakeholders and towards the planet, from soils to communities. Our original founders strive to be responsible actors and this is our mission to nurture this heritage, it is our mission to ensure that we maintain the right balance between our *business activities* and *the needs of nature*.

##### Moët Hennessy's SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS
In 2020, when I joined Moët Hennessy to lead the Sustainability, our Maisons had already made many things regarding environment and society. However, we decided to structure our commitments, define a common vision and accelerate to become an inspiring leader in the Wines and Spirits industry, which means
- Generate a **positive impact on the planet**
- Answer **consumers' new expectations**
- Engage **employees and communities**

We created a dedicated sustainability program called LIVING SOILS LIVING TOGETHER which bring Moët Hennessy's commitment to life. It is a program which meets expectations of LVMH environmental and CSR's programs. LIVING SOILS LIVING TOGETHER is structured around four key pillars and set objectives for 2030.

The first pillar is about regenerating soils which means to become a benchmark for sustainable agricultural practices and achieve 100% supplies from regenerative agriculture sources.

The second one is mitigating our climate impact. We aim to reduce our CO2 impact by 50% versus 2019 which a scope one, two and three, and to reduce our environmental footprint.

The third one is about engaging society as we want to be recognized as a committed leader and to play a positive role for our stakeholders and the society as a whole.

The last but not the least, is empowering our people. We are committed to attract and retain world class diverse talents, by being the most inclusive and engaged organization as possible. Four years later, as the journey is still a long way to go, we have made great achievements.

##### About REGENERATING SOILS
Regarding regenerating soils, we are conscious of the need to protect our complex ecosystem, and we know our viticultural and agricultural methods can make a real difference. That is why we have worked for many years following strict guidelines and have achieved the most widely recognized local environmental certifications.

Today, we accelerate our actions, through policies such as
- Pursuing reduction of **chemical inputs**
- Restoring and fostering **biodiversity**
- Preserving **water resources**

What is more? We engage our partners by sharing their best practices for sustainable and regenerative agriculture. For example, the most 100% of our own vineyards are certified by the highest standards in viticulture. In 2023, Château Galoupet was certified organic and Terrazas de Los Andes and Chandon Argentina, reached the Regenerative Organic Certification. Hundred percent of our own vineyards, is under pilot projects in regenerative viticulture such as cover cropping, viti or agroforestry and creating ecological corridors.

To go even further, we created in 2022, a two-day international forum, called the World Living Soil Forum, which bring together all stakeholders committed to soil health.

Water stewardship is also a big challenge for some of our vineyards. Especially in Argentina where water stress is high. It means, we need to go further than what we have already set, with drip and precise irrigation to reduce our water consumption. We work hand-in-and with WWF to achieve a global reduction of 30% global water consumption reduction worldwide by 2030. For example, we started to test regenerative hydrology in Spain with Numanthia and in France, with Château Galoupet.

**Determination and commitment of our teams** to these environmental, social, and societal responsibility issues **is key to making positive change together**.

#### Louis Vuitton partnering with People For Wildlife NGO
Louis Vuitton launched its sustainable roadmap in September 2020, called **The Committed Journey**. Learn more about its key pillars with **Christelle Capdupuy**, Sustainable Development Director at **Louis Vuitton**. Then, focus on concrete actions to **protect and regenerate biodiversity** with the 5-year global conservation agreement with People For Wildlife NGO.

A year after joining the People For Wildlife conservation charity in a five-year partnership to restore and preserve biodiversity in a vast Australian natural reserve, Louis Vuitton has shared the first results of initiatives for a 400,000-hectare area on the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia.

To assess the state of biodiversity in the area before the project launch, the first year of the People for Wildlife collaboration established baseline metrics, set up robust monitoring systems, and deployed operational scientific measurement equipment. This facilitates access to remote and challenging terrain.

Effective monitoring has led to the discovery of two new species in the Apudthama reserve: a unique mushroom species likely endemic to the area and a new snake species. The scientific community is currently studying grey and brown pythons.

Moreover, over half a million camera trap images have been collected, documenting the presence of numerous species and attesting to the health of the ecosystem and the diverse wildlife population in the reserve.

I am Christelle Capdupuy leading the Sustainable Development Department for Louis Vuitton since 2018. At Louis Vuitton, we launched in September 2020 our sustainable roadmap called Our Committed Journey, with a social roadmap aiming to impact positively society,  and an environmental roadmap aiming to preserve natural resources.

Our environmental goals are to
- Responsibly source all our raw materials
- Fight against climate change through an ambitious action plan to decrease our carbon emissions
- Deploy circular creativity processes
And we do that through quantified objectives towards 2025 and aligned with LIFE 360 commitments.

Our first stake is to responsibly source all our raw materials. So we are aiming to reach 100% of the raw materials we are using to be recycled or environmentally certified by 2025.  At the end of 2022, we already reached 78% (including 70% cotton, 96% leather, 93% wood, and 93% gold). Second objective that we have is to erase the use of single-use plastic for our packaging. By 2022, we already decrease by 43% the volume of this plastic in our packagings.

Our second stake is to fight against climate change. So in July 2021, we have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative to be part of the Pass 1.5 program to decrease our carbon emission. So we have got the ambition to limit the global warming to 1.5 degrees. And to do that, we have got to decrease our carbon footprint by 55%. At the end of 2022, we already reached -25% in this decrease (Reduction of the carbon footprint of a Louis Vuitton product vs 2018, 2030 target: -55%).

We are supporting these commitments with two main objectives. The first one is to equip all our stores in the world with LED bulbs (Stores fully LED: 64% Americans, 50% EMEA, 66% North Asia, 50% South Asia, 67% Japan), which are emitting less carbon because they are using less energy. Last but not least, we also want to run all our warehouses and workshops in the world with renewable energy. End of 2022, we already reached 70% of the energy used in these workshops and warehouses to come from renewable energy sources.

Our third stake is to deploy circular creativity processes for all our products: windows, fashion shows and events in the world. So we are targeting that 100% of our categories of products will be committed to this eco-design process through a lifecycle analysis measurement, meaning that we are going to measure the environmental impact of all our products by 2025. At the end of 2022, we already reached 60% of our categories of product to be committed to this eco-design process.

Last but no least, we are also aiming that 100% of the materials we are using for our windows, fashion shows and exhibitions will be whether recycled or coming from environmentally certified processes. And at the end of 2022, already 90% of the materials we are using for our fashion shows are whether recycled or environmentally certified.

##### People for Wildlife *Partnership*
We have been advancing since 2020 on the path of sustainable development through the objectives of Our Committed Journey and after 2 years, we felt ready to embrace a more holistic project, to strengthen our positive contribution on a global scale, beyond our own value chain. Thats why, in line with Louis Vuitton's objective of preserving natural resources we have signed beginning of 2023, a 5-year global conservation agreement with a Non Governmental Organization, People For Wildlife, to work together on protecting and regenerating biodiversity in a *1M* acres area in Queensland, in North of Australia, with its local community.

People for Wildlife is an Australian-based NGO focusing on the preservation of biodiversity which specifically aims to preserve key conservation lands around the globe. Created in 2020, this NGO is led by Dr. Daniel Natusch, a world-renowned conservationist expert, member of IUCN, who has been living and working there during his PhD. This project contributes to the LVMH target of restoring 5 million hectares of flora and fauna habitats by 2030 and to the recent objective of the COP15 dedicated to Biodiversity to protect 30% of the emerged areas in the world.

Concretely, we will be directly supporting scientific research in the field. We will be monitoring wildlife species and understand how to control invasive species. We will also be working on contributing to carbon sequestration by controlling fire and restoring habitats. And last but not least, we will be closely working with the local community to create sustainable economic models for nature-based materials.

As a conclusion, we do believe at Louis Vuitton that it is our absolute priority to contribute positively to the environment, both inside our organization and beyond our value-chain, by fighting against climate change and deploying a regenerative approach of nature.

#### Sustainable sourcing, regenerative agriculture & nature conservation projects at Parfums Christian Dior
Let us discover with **Cécile Lochard**, Global Sustainability Director at **Parfums Christian Dior**, how biodiversity preservation is a fundamental pillar of the Maison. Deep dive into some key initiatives, from sustainable sourcing, regenerative agriculture with Les Fleurs d'Exception du Pays de Grasse to the restoration of natural habitats through their partnership with WWF.

Dear all, I am Cécile Lochard, Global Sustainability Director at Parfums Christian Dior. I joined the Group nearly 10 years ago with an experience at Guerlain until end 2023, in the same position. As one of the leaders of the luxury beauty industry, our mission holds us accountable, guiding our priorities and actions regarding sustainability.

##### Biodiversity Pillar AT PARFUMS CHRISTIAN DIOR
Christian Dior was a creator deeply inspired by nature and flowers. As a result, biodiversity preservation is a fundamental pillar of our CSR roadmap, encompassing our climate trajectory, eco-design and eco-formulation, women's empowerment, talent engagement, craftsmanship and cultural heritage.

As part of our Biodiversity pillar, Parfums Christian Dior aims to *restore ecosystems* through *sustainable sourcing, regenerative agriculture* and *large-scale nature conservation* projects. The Maison promotes regenerative agriculture, a holistic agricultural approach inspired by natural ecosystems for both its iconic garden and natural ingredients (100% of our 42 gardens and partner gardens will be cultivated using organic and/or regenerative agriculture by 2030), as well as commodities such as alcohol and glycerine.

We support our suppliers by engaging a panel of experts to assess the positive impact of these new practices on
- Soil health
- Biodiversity
- Water management

Parfums Christian Dior Maison has always been closely linked to Grasse (South of France city) throughout its history.  Indeed, since 2009, Parfums Christian Dior has partnered with Les Fleurs d'Exception du Pays de Grasse, an association that has contributed to the revival of regional activity for a new generation of farmers committed to the family-farming model and sustainable practices.

In 2023, the Maison introduced a major assessment project with its partner growers in Grasse, focusing on crops, soil health and biodiversity. This ambitious project, conducted on 17 flower cultivation plots, identified many best agricultural practices, resulting in high regeneration scores. These results were achieved through practices such as
- Permanent **cover cropping**
- Controlled **inputs use**
- Moderate **soil disturbance** such as tilling

They also open the way prospects for action plans to further improve these scores. Similarly, alcohol and glycerin, our primary natural-origin raw materials in terms of supply volume, are carefully selected from non-exclusive partners dedicated to the beauty sector. These two ingredients account for over 50% of the composition of our fragrances and cosmetic formulas by volume. Our objective is that by 2030, *50%* of these *strategic raw materials* will come from *organic*, *regenerative*, or other *sustainable sources* with the ultimate aim of reaching 100%.

##### Partnership WITH WWF
Beyond practicing responsible agricultural and cultivation methods, Parfums Christian Dior is conscious that protecting biodiversity also requires restoring wild spaces, enabling the return of plant and animal species essential for ecosystem regeneration. That is why, since late 2023, the Parfums Christian Dior Maison is proud to sponsor WWF projects for the preservation and restoration of large space in France, North America and Mexico through an "umbrella species" protection approach, an approach inspired by our SAUVAGE fragrance, part of Dior's DNA.

An *umbrella species* is one that requires a *large habitat*, and its protection consequently protects *other plant* and *animal species* sharing the *same environment*. Preserving an umbrella species helps maintain the entire ecosystem, serving as both a regulator and an indicator of its vitality. Big cats are solitary animals with hunting and breeding territories spanning several dozen kilometres, making them perfect examples of umbrella species.

The goal of the WWF and Parfums Christian Dior alliance is to
- Restore the **fertility**
- Foster **ecosystem regeneration**
- Encourage of the **return of animal species** that had disappeared
This will allow wild nature to recover its biodiversity, strength and beauty. In France, Parfums Christian Dior supports a program for the preservation of 50 hectares of forest habitats in the Jura, Vosges and Vercors mountains. The Maison also contributes to a study of the Eurasian lynx population, a threatened species, which is an indicator of biodiversity in these forests.

In North America and Mexico, Parfums Christian Dior finances the preservation and restoration of 15,000 hectares of large spaces and natural corridors to revive biodiversity. We particularly hope for the return of jaguars, whose population is threatened with extinction due to human activity.

In conclusion, I hope you have gained insights into biodiversity challenges, particularly in the luxury beauty sector. Thank you for your attention!

### Climate
#### Fight Climate change with Sephora
Another pillar of LIFE 360, the LVMH environmental roadmap, is about **Climate**.

Let us meet **Katarzyna Wisniewska**, Corporate Social Responsibility Director at **Sephora**, who talks about Sephora's concrete commitments and initiatives.

Hello, I am Katarzyna Wisniewska, I have been managing Corporate Social Responsibility at Sephora Europe and Middle East for the last four years. In my job, I deal with social and environmental impacts related to our retail activities as well as with products proposed by our brand Sephora Collection. Today, I would like to present you the key challenges we are facing in terms of sustainability.

##### Key *Sustainability Challenges*
When you think Sephora obviously you think about beauty products we sell. The impacts related to product ingredients, manufacturing and packaging is the most important part of our environmental footprint. Additionally to sell those products, we need stores, beauty advisor, we run e-commerce activities, deliveries, marketing and promotions... All those activities we could qualify as retail operation and this is another significant source of our environmental impacts.

Sephora sustainability strategy is the response to current environmental challenges. We are committed to reduce carbon emissions, to reduce waste with particular focus on packaging and plastic, and we commit to offer more and more sustainable products and services. Our initiative are aligned with LVMH ambition framed by Life 360 Program. What type of initiative we put in place?

##### Our *climate Pillar*
As we have an important number of stores, it is key to act on energy consumption. We can do it via more efficient LED lighting systems, via more sober use of air conditioning/heating and minimum use of energy beyond opening hours. To reduce *CO2 impact* we made choice of using renewable energy contracts.

Last winter, within couple of months, Sephora reduce its *energy* consumption by nearly 20%. This performance has been awarded by LMVH. As the best energy saving plant within the group. Simultaneously it has been chosen as the best 2022 green project by Sephora employees. This result and this recognition are very encouraging for our teams who actually made this plan happen.

The same approach can apply to store deliveries. In France, 1/3 of stores are delivered by electric tracks and another have by natural gas-powered vehicles. We have also decided to manufacture our major retail elements like shopping bags, uniforms & gift boxes in Europe to limit transportation impacts.

If we look at the packaging side, to priority is reduction: for example, a new e-commerce solution is to ship small beauty items in envelopes rather than boxes. We can also collect our retail decoration and transform them into new resources. Tomorrow, we hope to be able to recycle them, to produce our own gift boxes with all collected cardboards.

Beyond handling our own direct initiatives, the superpower of Sephora, as a retailer is the influence brands and consumers. We can promote less overpacks or most sustainable solutions like refills. Via our Good for *sustainable* products selection, we are guiding our consumers to take more responsible choices while shopping at Sephora. By activating the whole Sephora eco-system, we can drive sustainable change in beauty.

##### Key *Takeaways*
Working on sustainability requires strategy, commitments and concrete action plans but it also about people's passion and individual contributions that the results are brought to life. My biggest personal satisfaction is that today at Sephora we have an active community of employees that feel engaged, that take actions and progressively change our companies' culture.

As a future employee do not hesitate to become yourself the real change maker. I believe this is how we will get to more sustainable future together.

#### Bvlgari's commitment to protect our planet
All LVMH Maisons contribute to making improvements regarding climate and biodiversity changes through their specific action plans for the years to come. But what to expect from a Maison like Bvlgari? What are its strategy and main pillars to fight for our planet?

**Agnese Maria Mazzi**, Engineering & Sustainability Associate Manager at **Bvlgari**, reveals how the iconic Italian Maison is committed to tackling climate change.

**At Bvlgari, creativity also means thinking for the community**

We are a team of architects, engineers, visual, event, creative people with a strong commitment to achieving high sustainability standards through creativity, innovation, and research. We had great teachers in the past, such as Bruno Munari (Italian artist 1907-1988) or Gio Ponti (Italian artist 1891-1979), who taught us that a designer does not work just for himself, to follow his own idea, a special shape or only the functionality of the object. 

**A designer works for the community**, considers **ethical and social impacts**, and today more than ever, also includes social responsibility and environmental impacts. This has always been part of our DNA and now we are reinforcing it, with a clearer strategy and an integrated vision among all the departments. We work mainly around **3 pillars**: **circular economy**, **eco-design** and **“give it back.”**

**Circular economy: a challenge accepted by creative minds**
At Bvlgari, we do not believe that creativity needs a white paper to be free to express itself. We trust that the limits and constraints can be a further challenge. This is the approach we take when designing our external animation vitrines, where we keep the same window structures, and we animate the seasonal launches only with new fabric lining and finishing. It is a great achievement in terms of saving materials, as there is a seasonal rollout worldwide 3 times a year. **It is always new but also always the same**. What is our Visual Merchandising team’s favorite motto?

**Reuse, Reinvent, Recycle! We focus on producing products that can be used and reused. Our objects should have many lives until they are recycled.** *Agness Maria Mazzi*

The same approach is followed for pop-ups and our high jewelry events: the furniture delivered to markets is designed and produced to be modular and itinerant. Year after year, different events with different moods are adapted with the same furniture to make sure we create a unique experience for our customers, always taking into account the environment in our strategy. Our best example is our huge stand in Basel, Switzerland. After being installed and dismantled 7 times this year, we finally had to dispose of the stand. With a careful recycling process, we have been able to reuse more than 166 tons of various metals.

**Eco-design: a sustainable approach for Bvlgari stores worldwide**

As the second pillar of Bvlgari’s sustainable strategy, **eco-design** guides the main choices for the **design concept** of our stores. All woods are FSC certified [^1], paints are water-based, and metals born from galvanization are moving to an eco-production process, through mechanical joints that may allow dismantling and **recycling** of the materials. A great effort has also been made for **lighting**: all stores are fully equipped with LEDs, with a concept focused on lighting only the product, with a dimming system that optimises the quantity of light needed, and with sensors and timers that further contribute to energy management.

For the future, shipping materials across the world is clearly a non-sense. We studied the impact of our delivery in our store in New York's 5th Avenue. For that construction finishing delivery, we were able to save over 1.000.000 kg of CO2 emitted, 74% of the total emissions, as we managed mainly boat delivery.

**“Give it back”: the future of creativity**

Our 3rd pillar, “Give It Back,” is highly valued at Bvlgari. We are grateful for what we have, and we have to compensate for our activities. A special project that we just launched is the special sustainable hoarding in Nanjing Deji, China. Bvlgari is no longer interpreting it as a pure commercial space to place brand campaign images; rather, we want to give it an additional twist. The back of the graphic is realized with a special fabric capable of filtering pollutants and viruses, also COVID, to give back clean air.

**Reach carbon neutrality: a goal for Bvlgari and humanity**

We know that our last objective for humanity is not to reduce emissions, but to reach carbon neutrality. We trust the new generation of creative people to be able to analyse the impact of our activities and propose compensation ideas to reach this major goal. In our Valenza factory, on top of very high parameter standards in terms of reduction of energy consumption, 100% of green energy will ensure a saving of 7.000.000 Kg of CO2 in 4 years. Additionally, the team also worked in starting an environmental compensation activity, remote from the construction site itself, but still impactful for the area.

This is the next border for creativity applied to sustainability, and we will need all the help of the next generation of talents to build a better future together.

### Traceability and Transparency
#### Focus on Tiffany & Co.
At Tiffany & Co. sustainability is not just a commitment but an integral part of the Maison's identity.

Hear from **Victoria Reynolds**,  Vice President, Chief Gemologist at **Tiffany & Co.**, how she procures the most beautiful gemstones and diamonds in the world to adorn Jewelry Collections, while respecting the highest social and environmental standards including **responsible sourcing** and **full traceability**.

I begin my career at Tiffany in 1983 as a summer intern, going into my junior year at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and then graduated from RISD in 1985 with a degree in Jewelry Design. In 1987, Tiffany offered me a position in the Custom Design department, which I was thrilled to except. And since that time, I have loved every moment of my 36 years with Tiffany.

I believe that it is the sum of all of the positions that I have held during this time that led me to become the Chief Gemologist and Vice President of High Jewelry, Diamond and Gemstone Acquisition in 2020. In addition to custom design, I worked in the diamond lab for four years as a grader and during that time, received my Graduate Gemology degree. And most recently, before becoming Chief Gemologist, as Vice President of High Jewelry Category Management and Product Development.

My main mission as Chief Gemologist is to *procure the most beautiful gemstones and diamonds in the world* to adorn or Jewelry Collections, all of which are *responsibly sourced and have full traceability*. Additionally, I am a spokesperson for the House as well as support or VVIP clients at global high jewelry events.

##### Social & Environmental COMMITMENTS AT TIFFANY & CO.
At Tiffany & Co., sustainability is not just a commitment, but rather an integral part of our House identity. Something that lies at the heart of everything we do. With a 185-year heritage, we believe that it is our *responsibility* to be at the *vanguard of sustainable luxury*.

We pride ourselves on the responsible sourcing of materials and prioritizing ethical practices that positively impact both the environment and local communities. Responsible sourcing at Tiffany & Co. means supporting:
- Human Rights
- Fair Labor
- Environmental Conservation

Tiffany's social and environmental accountability program (SEA), aims to embed responsible sourcing practices into our supply chain. Through this initiative, we replace a traditional audit approach and directly engage with suppliers, which contributes to high performance across our supply chain. Our *dedication* to sustainability extends far beyond the *initial creation* of our pieces. At Tiffany & Co., we believe that love, as well as our jewelry, should stand the test of time.

##### About Diamond TRACEABILITY
One of the biggest challenges the diamond industry faced was diamond traceability. Tiffany has been deeply committed to offering the highest social and environmental standards, so *transparency* and *conducting our business in a responsible way* is something that our clients expect from us.

In 2020, we became the first global luxury jeweler to disclose full craftsmanship journey of our diamonds from the region or countries of origin where the stone was mined to where it was cut, polished and graded and then set. As part of our Diamond Craft Journey, we work to ensure that responsible practices take place every step of the way.

In communities around the world, mining and trading colored gemstones is a cultural tradition and source of livelihood passed down for generations. Approximately 80% of the world's colored gemstones come from small scale, artisanal minds spanning more than 40 countries. And the industry is highly complex, making it difficult to trace the gems' origins.

Tiffany & Co. uses strict protocols for sourcing the approximately 60 varieties of gems used in its jewelry. And we are helping set industry standards that account for the realities of the supply chain, while seeking to increase transparency and traceability.

##### Industry COLLABORATION
Tiffany & Co. collaborates to create standards and share best practices to promote responsible gemstones supply chains. In 2015, Tiffany joined others in the luxury jewelry industry and colored gemstone mining sector to form the Colored Gemstone Working Group, which has developed
- Due-diligence tools
- Training materials
- Other resources
for the colored gemstone sector.

Through industry partnerships and philanthropy, Tiffany and the Tiffany & Co. Foundation also support a range of stakeholders, from miners and traders to cutters and polishers, to help the colored gemstone sector supports sustainable livelihoods in places around the world where people depend on it.

The subjects regarding **sustainability** and **traceability** is continually evolving, and it is one of the most exciting parts about my position. But one thing will remain constant: my mission of finding the world's most exceptional diamonds and colored gemstones, and leading our industry and sourcing them in an **ethical** fashion will be even more important in the future.

#### Focus on Fendi
Explore with **Séverine Pinault**, Supply Chain, Sustainability & Logistics Director at **Fendi**, how the Maison develops a more responsible supply chain, with more **transparency** and **traceability**.

Hello everyone, my name is Séverine Pinault and I am Supply Chain, Sustainability & Logistic Director at Fendi. I joined Fendi 4 years and a half ago and I am located in Rome in Italy. Before joining Fendi, I had worked in various Supply Chain & Logistic positions at Christian Dior Couture for more than 10 years.

Two years ago, I had the opportunity to expand my scope and to drive the Fendi Sustainability strategy. I felt really excited by this new challenge as I have a true sensitivity to that topic in my personal life. At the same time, I measured the responsibility I had considering the rising awareness and pressure on that topic.

I am convinced that overseeing **Supply Chain & Sustainability** together is a strength. As Supply Chain Director, I have a key role of interface between all functions: industrial, product, merchandising, logistics... with a wide picture of the business. This role of interface helps me daily to manage more efficiently our global Sustainability roadmap.

At Fendi, together with my team and with the support of the Top Management, we strive to build a sustainability strategy aligned with LVMH Life 360 roadmap and characterized by a pragmatic and a transversal approach. As an example, each member of the Management Committee has a clear objective on Sustainability among their annual objectives. As you may know, LVMH Life 360 is based on 4 pillars:
- Creative circularity
- Biodiversity
- Climate
- Transparency

##### Focus *on Transparency*
Why transparency? Because Fendi is best in class among LVMH Fashion brands. Why Fendi is best in class? As we are working every day to build a more responsible Supply Chain, we think we can be confident to be transparent and for example to disclose the full list of our suppliers.

##### What is a *Responsible Supply Chain for Fendi*?
As a Roman luxury Maison, as a Maison representing the 'Made in Italy' worldwide, the preservation of the Italian craftsmanship synonymous with tradition, quality, excellence is at the heart of Fendi commitments. At Fendi, 98% of our products are *made in Italy* and we are proud to have built a supply chain almost entirely located in Italy based on collaborations with hundreds of highly skilled artisans.

Another testimony of Fendi strong commitment to support the Made in Italy is our investment on the Italian territory. 2022 was a special year of Fendi with the opening of 2 new *state of the art* factories:
- a leather goods factory integrated in the hills of Tuscany
- a shoes factory in the center of Italy.
These factories are key assets for Fendi but even more important are the artisans. One key mission of Fendi is to recruit, to train, to develop the next generation of highly skilled artisans. For example, we are proud of our internal Fendi Leather School to train our new joiners.

We have our internal factories, but we have as well a lot of external suppliers and we want to ensure the same level of environmental and social standards. To support this commitment, we have built an extensive monitoring program to support not only our first-tier suppliers but as well our second-tier suppliers. The suppliers of our suppliers in partnership with an independent auditing company. In 2022, 83% of our production is coming from audited suppliers.

##### How do we Bring more *Transparency at Fendi*?
Let me explain first what is the Fashion Transparency Index. Fashion Revolution is a movement that was created in 2013 further to the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh pushing Fashion/Luxury brands to *be transparent* on their social & environmental practices all along their supply chain. They have created the Fashion Transparency Index to promote transparency and accountability in our Supply Chain.

Why at Fendi are we committed to be best in class in the Fashion Transparency index? First we see it as an opportunity to question ourselves on our practices and the practices of our suppliers. Second, it is becoming a must have, a strong expectation from all our stakeholders. Our clients do not want to know only where it is manufactured but how it is manufactured, what are the raw material we use, where is it stitched?

How does the Fashion Transparency Index work concretely? It covers *250 indicators* on 5 pillars. For example, we need to answer to: what are the policies and commitments for our employees? But as well for our suppliers employees? How is organized the governance of people in charge of social and environmental performance? Do we communicate the list our suppliers? How do we monitor our suppliers? What do we do with our unsold products?

##### Where are we *Today*?
Where are we today at Fendi? In 2020, we were at the same level as the other LVMH Fashion Maisons mainly relying on LVMH communications and reaching a score at 20-25%. End of 2020, we did a big step ahead with the creation of our *Sustainability* website & the publication of the list of all our suppliers allowing us to reach *43% in 2021*. In 2022, we continued to enrich our website and we reached 53%, being second luxury brand. In 2023, we hope to reach an even higher level.

##### Key *Takeaways*
The next big challenge on which we are working at Fendi is to bring this level of transparency and traceability not only at our company level but at each single product level.

I would like to finish by sharing a thought with you. Whatever is your function, your position within the company, from marketing to production, from retail to finance, from legal to IT sustainability commitments, social and environmental commitments need to be integrated in your daily job. Better to be prepared for it.

#### Guerlain’s Bee Respect Platform
**Claire Coletti**, Global Sustainability Director at **Guerlain**, talks about the Guerlain’s Bee Respect platform, an initiative which allows everyone to discover the behind-the-scenes details of Guerlain’s creations.

**Does being in charge of sustainable development issues give more meaning to your role as a manager?**
I must  admit that I have a job that fascinates me. I am extremely fortunate to have a team that shares my passion. We also measure this luck by the number of job applications we receive. Despite everything, we are always up for a challenge with sometimes difficult targets. We can also deal with anxiety-provoking subjects. This ambition requires **collective efforts** on a daily basis.

**Our responsibility of impact and our business objective is to market and offer creations that are both the most natural and the lightest in terms of carbon emissions and footprint in the broad sense, in complete transparency.** *Clair Coletti*

**How was the Bee Respect platform launched in 2019 born?**
Bee Respect  is a very “tech” project. It is a **digital revolution** applied to a dual connected requirement of **transparency** and **traceability**. We are fortunate with Guerlain to be seen as a maison linked to nature. It is even in the DNA of the brand with the bee signature. Our Group has been very committed since 1992, and "Bee Respect" marks an important step in opening up transparency on our supply chain and the **whole life cycles of our products**. For over 4 years, Guerlain has been committed to a long and rigorous process of mapping the life cycle of its products. In 2019, we launched "Bee Respect", our transparency and traceability platform designed in partnership with Product DNA (architects of traceability). Accessible to all via our website guerlain.com, it is also a valuable tool for internal teams, a valuable tool for continuous improvement (particularly in terms of environmental impact), from the flower field to our customers.

**Does Bee Respect demonstrate an evolution of the customer relationship and experience?**
We started  working on this platform in 2015. This platform Bee Respect, intuitively, is **a new relationship with the consumer**. It is a **revolution** in itself. This requirement of transparency, asked us to go up the value chain and recreate the link with the customer. In a way, this is a way of breaking away a little from the adage that luxury does not reveal its secrets, its backstage. We felt this **need for communication**  very early on. Regarding the products, we went to look for labels such as third party certifiers as well as the programs of retailers like Sephora. Everyone was put on the same level in terms of “Clean beauty” or Naturalness.

**How does this tool guarantee this transparency?**
We have a very strong ambition to be **exemplary**.  Engaging in this process of mapping products was very long and required a lot of rigor to meet this expectation and this requirement of details on the information of all the products and all the creations. We mobilized 250 employees, partners and suppliers. Today we are focusing on **internationalization**:  we have recently launched the site for the United States and planned to put online new countries in Asia.  It is a rather complex process, each country has its own regulations.  It has long been believed that sustainability is not always marketing's best friend. The Bee Respect experience proves the contrary and responds to this need for **concrete and precise** information  to the deep questions on environmental footprint and climate change.

**How does the naturalness strategy fit into the LVMH Group's zero carbon objective for 2028?**
We are fortunate to have this powerful backbone of the unique connection to nature, this history linked to biodiversity and natural ingredients. We must not forget that Guerlain is also the inventor of synthesis in perfumery. The product must also respond to an essential alliance between its functionality and sensoriality. The equation must be subtle and respond to an ecosystem. This alliance will never be one hundred percent natural. Sustainable innovation is like a healthy mind in a healthy body. At Guerlain, the spirit is the formula, and the healthy body is the packaging. Here, too, we are completely transparent

Ahead of each new product development, our Marketing, Development, and Sustainable Development teams work together to set ambitious yet realistic goals according to the 3 following indicators:
- **The Environmental Performance Index (EPI)**:  is a grade out of 20 that determines whether the rules of eco-design are being well implemented. This grade is calculated using software developed by LVMH for use by all Maisons. As a reporting tool, it measures what eco-design progress is being achieved by the Maison as well as throughout the Group more globally. For each new development, we broadly aim for a minimum grade, and each re-launch of an already existing product will be re-launched with an improved grade better than its predecessor.
- **CO2**: With each new development, we commit to producing less CO2 than its predecessor. This indicator corresponds to the equivalent CO2 created by the product packaging and transportation in the world.
- Finally, we follow the **3 Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**, in this precise order. We endeavor to develop products that integrate all three Rs. From an environmental standpoint, the highest performing products are therefore those with a grade higher than 12 and a significantly reduced CO2 impact compared to the product it replaces, while also meeting three R objectives (Reduced packaging, using Recycled materials and designed to encourage Recycling.)

**Does the lasting transparency of Bee Respect strengthen the brand's position in its market segment? **

I am convinced that sustainability meets performance. I would even say that today, it is beyond that. We are condemned if we do not meet these requirements for transparency and traceability and, in essence, the expectations of our consumers.

Both certification and traceability guarantees a virtuous circle in our way of sourcing the wonders of nature at the heart of all our creations for nearly 200 years. It is to protect them and to be able to pass them on that we are committed to the quality of the cultivation and the traceability of our sustainable natural ingredients: whether it is orchid, honey but also neroli, ylang, rose, etc. We audit them on both the environmental and social aspects, aiming for continuous improvement. **Luxury would not exist without biodiversity**, and this is a very upstream approach at the sourcing stage that improves the quality of our products.

From a more societal angle, we connected the dots between bees and society with our latest program, “Women for Bees,” developed with UNESCO. This program is designed to train women beekeepers in UNESCO Biosphere Reserves worldwide. Surely, we will rely on the Bee Respect platform to update and visualize all the places we install beekeepers and beehives!

**Both certification and traceability are the guarantee of a virtuous circle in our way of sourcing the wonders of nature** *Clair Coletti*

### The floor is yours
##### Take 30min to consider how to make each stage of a product's life cycle more environmentally friendly
LVMH is increasingly involved in Creative Circularity through its LIFE 360 program, aiming to apply eco-design principles to all new products by 2030.

Choose a product (e.g., perfume, Champagne, watch, bag, sweatshirt) and, using your experience, this module's content, or online research, develop concrete eco-design ideas for it.

Name your chosen **product** and list what can be improved on its **conception** (materials, innovation, ...)
```text
To align with LVMH's LIFE 360 program, the following concrete eco-design improvements can be implemented for a luxury watch, focusing on material innovation and sustainable conception.

1. Material Sourcing and Innovation:
   Utilize certified recycled stainless steel and traceable, ethical gold for the case and bracelet, verified through a blockchain-based system.
   Replace mined diamonds with lab-grown gemstones for all decorative elements to eliminate environmental and ethical concerns associated with mining.
   Develop watch straps from bio-based alternatives (e.g., Piñatex from pineapple leaves) or high-performance recycled fabrics.

2. Manufacturing and Production:
   Power manufacturing facilities with 100% renewable energy.
   Implement closed-loop water systems and waste-heat recovery technologies to minimize resource consumption and emissions during production.

3. Distribution and Logistics:
   Prioritize low-carbon transport (maritime and electric ground vehicles) for logistics.
   Redesign packaging to be minimalist, using FSC-certified recycled paper and plant-based inks, and introduce a durable, reusable watch case.

4. Use and Longevity:
   Offer a lifetime service and repair guaranteeto extend product lifespan.
   Design the watch with modular, interchangeable components (e.g., straps, bezels) to facilitate personalization and repair, reducing the need for replacement.

5. End-of-Life and Circularity:
   Establish a take-back program to reclaim watches from customers.
   Design the watch for easy disassembly to enable efficient material recovery and recycling, thereby closing the material loop.

By integrating these measures, the luxury watch becomes a model of circularity, combining enduring value with demonstrable environmental responsibility.

### Go further with Regenerative Luxury
#### Design in the context of a planetary emergency
Professor **Carole Collet**, Director of Maison/0, the **Central Saint Martins LVMH** creative platform for regenerative luxury, discusses design strategies that address some of our critical ecological challenges.

She discusses going **beyond the idea of sustainability and transitioning to a regenerative practice** that helps replenish our climate, biodiversity, and communities.

I am professor Carole Collet and I am the director of Maison 0, the Central Saint Martins LVMH creative platform for regenerative luxury. I am based at Central Saint Martins in London. In this video, I will show you a range of design strategies to address some of our critical ecological challenges via a creative lens.

Whilst there are many different approaches, my message for you today is that we need to accelerate our environmental actions. We need to go beyond the idea of sustainability, where too often the focus is simply minimizing impact. I will argue that we now need to transition to a regenerative design practice that helps replenish our climate, our biodiversity and our communities.

##### Why Are We Speaking *About a Planetary Emergency*?
So first of all, why are we speaking about a planetary emergency? There are two key critical challenges I want to address today. First, the rapid decline of our biodiversity. In the past 40 years, we have lost nearly 60% of our wildlife population. We know that at least 1 million species are at risk of extinction because of human activities. Yet, we depend on other species every day. Think of how insects pollinate the food we eat. Ecosystem services are critical for our own survival and we have taken them for granted. It is urgent that we reverse our biodiversity rapid decline and help replenish our ecosystems. So how do we design to nurture and replenish our biodiversity? It is a new paradigm for us designers.

The second critical challenge is climate warming. The International Paris Agreement treaty requires that we limit our climate warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius increase compared to pre-industrial time. We now have eight years left as of 2022 to halve our carbon emission. A very difficult task. The time to act is now and whilst it is a tough challenge, it also opens up *new creative opportunities* for us. So a key question for design is how do we integrate impactful carbon sinking strategies in the creative process?

##### How to Integrate Ecological Principles *in the Creative Process*?
Clearly, business as usual is not an option and the creative sector, like others, we need to respond to these critical challenges. So I will now show you some examples of some of our projects where we explore new ways to adopt ecological principles in the creative process.

I will start with a series of projects produced in collaboration with the Master of Biodesign and the LVMH environment team. These were presented at the IUCN Congress of Nature in 2021.

This is algalip by Eleonora Rombolà. Algalip is a prototype for a new lipstick 100% made from algae. The lip balm, the colourant and even the packaging all made from algae. Here, the designer chose to explore the potential to create a mono-material product made with one biological ingredient. By using this approach, she succeeded in removing petro-chemicals, which emit carbon, and are normally used in lipstick production. The benefit of this concept is that algae eat carbon and release oxygen as they grow. A win-win scenario, potentially generating a carbon negative lipstick.

Here is Excessories, a project by Cassie Quinn, designed to address the issue of textile dye waste water which is toxic for aquatic life. Here, Cassie uses a natural polymer called chitin, extracted from waste oyster shells to filter dye waste water. At the end of the process, the chitin self assembles in a biopolymer film which is then used to produce biodegradable sequins. This results in clean water and a new biomaterial that can be used to replace oil-based plastic sequins. By thinking in systems, Cassie combines the by-product of a food system with the by-product of a textile waste stream to achieve a nature-positive outcome for both textiles and aquatic life.

Around the world our intensive farming models have depleted our soils. Today we understand that we need to transition to new forms of agriculture. With his project, Luis Undritz developed a series of 'biome fruits' designed specifically for the champagne terroir and engineered to host local endemic beneficial insects and microorganisms. Informed by permaculture principles, these pods are designed to be hung amongst the vineyards and in addition to providing bespoke insect habitats, they will release seeds and nutrients to regenerate the soil throughout the year. The outcome is a family of products designed for multi-species that can help champagne production transition to a regenerative system.

And finally, I will show you another project developed in collaboration with the LVMH environment team. Here, the brief was to develop new nature-positive materials for luxury stores. Our designers, Brigitte Kock and Irene Roca Moracia, chose to create tiles made from materials derived from two invasive species: the Japanese Knotweed and the American Signal Crayfish. One of the causes of our biodiversity decline is invasive species that take over the resources and habitats of local species to the point of threatening them, thus creating major collapses in ecosystems. By developing a new use for these two species, we can incentivize further their removal and help ecosystems recover. Again here we can see that the starting point for the creative process is the regeneration of an ecosystem. And the final product, in this case, a collection of tiles, is the consequence of that regenerative process.

##### Key *Takeaways*
I will now conclude with four key learnings:
1. Design for more than a human world.
2. Learn from Nature and adopt bio-informed creative strategies.
3. Integrate system thinking in our creative process and consider the act of design as part of a web of life.
4. Transition to a regenerative culture where design can actively reverse socio-ecological damage.
Now it is up to you to engage with a form of creativity that nourishes our world. Thank you.

*LVMH has a partnership with the Central Saint Martins school in London, which focuses on regenerative luxury. The partnership's ambition is to harness the power of creative collaboration to confront climate and biodiversity emergencies and empower emerging talents through creative education to design a better future.*

## LVMH POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY
### Our social responsibility
#### LVMH's heritage and Maisons' success anchored in their respect for society and communities.
At LVMH, we are driven by a strong **sense of responsibility** towards society.
As a leading group, at LVMH we have the responsibility to stay in touch with the world around us because we are driven by the belief that **people** – whether those employed by the Group or those with whom we work – **make the difference**.

Our long-term commitments yield tangible benefits for society. LVMH views social responsibility as not simply an obligation, but an imperative and a source of competitiveness. Together, we are committed to making excellence a driver for social and professional inclusion in solidarity with our host regions and communities as we strive to cascade the positive social impact of our activities.

We are committed to making *excellence* a driver for *social* and *professional* inclusion.

Let us now discover the four pillars of social responsibility.

##### Respecting the *uniqueness* of our *employees*
We foster an inclusive organization that celebrates what makes each employee and each candidate special.

##### Passing on and developing *savoir-faire*
The preservation of craftsmanship and design is a fundamental concern, as it guarantees excellence for our Maisons and safeguards our reputation throughout the world.

##### Supporting our employees by improving their *safety* and *well-being*
Employee well-being requires action in all areas directly and indirectly related to health and safety.

##### Empowering *local communities*
As a leading company in the global economy, at LVMH we feel a strong sense of responsibility towards the regions in which we operate.

### Diversity & Inclusion at LVMH
At LVMH, Diversity and Inclusion is *everyone's business*

#### It is everyone's business
Deep dive with **Vanessa Moungar**, Group Diversity and Inclusion Director for **LVMH**, into the **Group's vision** and discover how Diversity and Inclusion are **cross-cutting all our business** to ensure long-term performance.

She shares our three action pillars: **PEOPLE**, **PARTNERS** and **IMAGE**.

Hello, my name is Vanessa Moungar and I am the Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer for the LVMH Group. And I am a citizen of France and Chad, but I truly feel like a citizen of the world as I have had the privilege of living in various countries, from Europe to Africa and America, working across the private, public and non profit sectors.

I started my career in the US, where I worked for 10 years in retail and distribution in New York and completed my Master's degree in Boston, before moving to Switzerland to join the World Economic Forum and start working on issues of women and youth empowerment. After that, I moved to Côte d'Ivoire, to lead the department of Gender, Women and Civil Society at the African Development Bank and work on women empowerment across Africa's 54 countries. In parallel, I had the opportunity to join the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council to advise G7 leaders on best practices to fight inequalities based on gender and origins. I joined LVMH two years ago to lead our global efforts on Diversity & Inclusion at Group level.

##### Could you Explain your Role at LVMH? *Your Key Responsibilities?*
My role is to lead the implementation of our global roadmap, to coordinate our actions towards our common goals, and to create synergies amongst our Maisons to share best practices. We are committed to fostering an *inclusive* culture in which all stakeholders, starting with our talents, starting with our tenants, but also our partners and clients, feel welcome, respected and represented. It is not only the right thing to do, we strongly believe that it is a source of creativity and performance.

Animated by this vision, we have set clear and measurable global objectives, starting with our talents: to achieve parity 50% of women in all key positions and salary equity, to employ 2% of people living with disability by 2025 and 5% as a long-term goal. We work on these targets through the active engagement of our Human Resources community and special initiatives spanning from recruitment and training, to salary equity in career development and we closely monitor progress.

For instance, through the *EllesVMH* program, we aim to *accelerate the professional development of women* across the Group. In 15 years, the percentage of women in *key positions* rose from 23% to 45% in 2022. Beyond our targets at Group level, we work closely with our 75 Maisons to stimulate innovation and impulse impactful initiatives, aligned with their cultures, their sectors and their DNA. We rely on a vibrant community of experts working in each of our Maisons and driving progress on Diversity and Inclusion. Each year, we recognize the best initiatives implemented by Maisons through the Inclusion Index, which is our tool to capture our impact and measure the change we operate through all our actions.

##### What is your Vision *of Diversity and Inclusion*?
Diversity & Inclusion are interconnected. They need to work together to be real change makers. Diversity is a fact, it refers to the variety of unique individuals that make a team diverse. Differences between individuals can be visible such as gender or skin colour, but also invisible such as our personal backgrounds, countries you have lived in, life experiences that shape who we are as individuals and help us bring diverse perspectives to the table. It is that *diversity* that makes our business more creative, more innovative and stronger every day.

Diversity, however, is not enough to create an inclusive corporate culture that leads to performance. Culture is made up of the daily actions of every one of us in the Group, and that is actually captured in our motto: we are diverse by essence, inclusive by choice and it is everyone's business. Our notion of an inclusive culture is one where everyone feels empowered to contribute and thrive, regardless of their background. Above all, we want to reflect the reality of our markets and offer development opportunities to all, that are based solely on merits and skills.

##### Our *Pillars of Action*
Diversity & Inclusion is cross-cutting to our business. We are diverse by nature with 190 nationalities, operating in more than 80 countries with 4 generations at work. Our Maisons have a wide breadth of métiers and the Group is represented in all the luxury sectors. So we have three main pillars of action.

Number one, people: which is about ensuring inclusive practices into the entire employee journey that spans from recruitment processes free of any forms of discrimination, to equitable career development opportunities for all. We develop specific training programs for recruiters, of course, but also for all the tenants, such as the unconscious bias e-learning that is available to all our talents across the group. We also rely on our amazing employee networks around the world EllesVMH, our Women's network or our LVMH Pride, our network for LGBTI+ inclusion and lead for LVMH employees of African descent. These groups of talents from their communities and their allies come together to support each other, to learn from each other, and they work with us as business partners to further drive a culture of inclusion within the Group.

Number two, partners: we extend this vision through our entire supply chain, by ensuring that the partners we work with are aligned with our values and principles for impact through our wide ecosystem. We also encourage our Maisons to proactively diversify their supply chains to ensure that underrepresented groups are part of our journey.

Number three, image: we want to make sure everyone feels represented and respected from our marketing campaigns to our store experience. We also amplify and advocate for the promotion of Diversity & Inclusion through global communications, putting the spotlight on our engagement and reflecting the diversity of our talents, sectors and métiers. Our Maisons also strive to represent the diversity of our clients and reflect the plurality of the world, while mirroring the local fabric of societies.

##### Which are the Stakes *or Key Future Challenges*?
When talking about Diversity & Inclusion, there is no one size fits all. Our role is to ensure that our core values and global commitment resonate around the world but it is crucial to adapt specific initiatives to local contexts. The past few years have seen a momentum on topics of diversity and inclusion around the world, and we must ensure that it is not only sustained, but leads to concrete actions and systemic change in terms of equal access to opportunity for all not in our organisations, but also in societies around the world.

##### A *Final Word?*
At LVMH, people make the difference. We all have a role to play, and to be inclusive is not a luxury, it is a choice and it is everyone's business.

### Focus on strategic D&I topics
#### Focus on LVMH commitments in North America
Learn from **Corey Smith**, Vice President of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion at **LVMH North America**, how Diversity and Inclusion topics have evolved in recent years and the results of LVMH's actions in North America.

**The LVMH notion of an inclusive culture is one where everyone feels empowered to contribute and thrive, regardless of their background.** *Corey Smith*

My name is Corey Smith, and I am the Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for North America, for the LVMH Group. I have worked in DEI for over 20 years, starting in Supply Chain Diversity and expanding the scope of the role to all business functions of a company, including HR, Sales, Operations, Marketing and Branding Engagement. I have worked in a variety of industries from technology, education, consumer packaged goods, entertainment and media, sports, and now Luxury goods. I joined LVMH four years ago to lead our North America efforts on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the Group level.

##### Diversity & Inclusion AT THE HEART OF LVMH VALUES
Diversity and Inclusion is at the heart of LVMH values. The LVMH values of
- innovation & creativity
- Excellence
- Entrepreneurship
- Commitment to Positive Impact
are directly aligned with Diversity and Inclusion.

At its core, Diversity & Inclusion is about *leveraging differences* to produce *better results*. What I mean by that is people with different and unique backgrounds, characteristics, skill sets, experiences and levels of expertise all working together to drive innovation and creativity because they all contribute different ideas. Homogenous thinking drives *sameness not innovation*. It is the *diversity of thought* that allows *innovation*, *creativity* and *excellence* to thrive.

By being inclusive of diverse thought and allowing individuals to be entrepreneurial in their thinking, we commit to a more positive impact, not only for the business, but for the communities where we operate, as well as society as a whole, because we will have included the thought processes and perspectives from people from all walks of life.

Now, what is important to note is that diversity of thought is born out of *physical diversity*. It is born not only out of our physical attributes, but also the physical spaces and environments we are in throughout our lives. So your exposure to more or less physical diversity directly correlates to how diverse your thinking can and will be, and its application to corporate culture.

The same principle holds true for LVMH. We are diverse by *nature*, and inclusive by *choice*. The diversity of our Maisons across different business segments drives good business and profitability. The diversity, excellence and entrepreneurship of our workforce, including business leaders, creative directors and manufacturing talent all allow for innovation and business relevance. The only way this works is if we continue to *include diverse voices and perspectives* in our business process.

##### Evolution of DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION (DEI)
The DEI journey for LVMH has been one of commitment to inclusion and equity. This commitment is not a recent one. It began with our LVMH commitment to create a more inclusive workplace for women well over 15 years ago, and continues today.

As we saw success on the gender journey, it has recently afforded us the opportunity to commit replicating that success across other dimensions of diversity, such as
- LGBTQIA+
- People with disabilities
- Race
- Ethnicity
- People of Colour

In some respects, the issues are the same, which is ensuring there is
- inclusion
- Equity
- The opportunity to exceed your potential
for all of our talent at LVMH.

I am happy to report that in all of those areas, we are making progress in some cases, we have already achieved and exceeded our goals here in North America. We understand this is a permanent and long-term commitment because we believe it has true business value. So even as the narrative around DEI has changed somewhat in recent years, our commitment to creating a more inclusive place for our talent and clients remains. Above all, we want to reflect *the world* that we live in, *the customers* that we serve, and *the employees* that work for us.

##### Collaborating with OUR MAISONS
Working with the different Maisons has been inspiring because they each have nuances about the brand that provide for different types of corporate cultures. Understanding the brand heritage in savoir-faire has been instrumental in ensuring that there is success from a DEI perspective.

One of the exercises at Maison level we have been successful with was reviewing the uniform and grooming guidelines of the retail talent. In looking at ways to be more inclusive of our talent and creating a workplace of belonging, a review of some of our policies has been necessary.
- Guidelines around gender identity within our uniform policies
- Grooming related to hairstyle and hair texture
- Grooming aesthetics based on skin tone
have all elevated the work experience of our retail talent to allow them to be more authentic at work and therefore feel more comfortable.

Which in turn increases their
- Productivity
- Sense of belonging
- Dedication to their Maison
and ultimately the overall business.

We also have several trainings that we now offer around DEI to help our talent become more culturally agile as it relates to working with colleagues, but also related to our client experience in the stores. Training on
- Unconscious Bias
- Workplace Inclusion
- Inclusive leadership
are part of our DEI learning and development curriculum.

As we continue to have a more diverse workforce, it is critically important that we have leaders that know how to lead diverse teams through cultural, agility and empathy. To foster an environment of equity, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we must remain relevant in an evolving and changing world.

At LVMH, people make the difference. We all have a role to play and to be inclusive is not a luxury. It is a choice. And it is everyone's business. We view DEI is a component of social responsibility and therefore a social right. We also understand value for our business and how it drives our business forward.

We know creating an inclusive organization is not only beneficial to our talent and how we recruit new talent, but it also drives our client engagement and experience and therefore our business growth. Internally, creating an environment where our talent is valued for their authenticity and expertise is at the core of our values. And we know that it will drive our business productivity via the innovation and creativity. That diversity of thought will organically trigger.

Simultaneously ensuring that our external storytelling covers diverse perspectives, helps our global image, and keeps our clients engaged and loyal. Diversity, however, is not enough to create an inclusive corporate culture that leads to performance. Culture is made up of the daily actions of everyone of us in the Group and that is captured in our motto. We are diverse by *essence* inclusive by *choice* and it is everyone's business. Our notion of an inclusive culture is one where everyone feels empowered to contribute and thrive, regardless of their background.

#### Diversity and Inclusion in Asia Pacific
Get an inside look at Diversity and Inclusion in Asia Pacific. **Kai Chen**, Diversity & Inclusion Director at **LVMH Asia Pacific**, shares the Group's commitments, key initiatives, and the role of ERGs (Employee Resource Groups) in fostering an inclusive workplace.

**When we embrace diversity, we unlock extraordinary potential in individuals, in teams, and the communities we serve.** *Kai Chen*

Hello, my name is Kai Chen, and I have the privilege of leading Diversity & Inclusion for LVMH across Asia Pacific. This is not just a professional role for me. It is deeply personal. Growing up in rural China, becoming the first one in my family to attend university, and then pursuing a PhD in Hong Kong. I have lived the journey of navigating different cultures and identities, experience firsthand the power of opportunities and the barriers that can stand in its way.

My career began in academia, shifted to banking, and now, at LVMH. I bridge my passion for people with the transformative potential of luxury. One lesson has stayed constant. When we *embrace diversity*, we unlock *extraordinary potential* in individuals, in teams and the communities we serve.

##### Corporate Social Responsibility IN ASIA PACIFIC
Asia Pacific is not one market. It is a mosaic of cultures, economies and social realities. This diversity is our strength, but it also means Corporate Social Responsibility challenges here are uniquely complex. One issue close to my heart? Social mobility. Ensuring that where you start in life does not dictate where you end up.

In luxury retail, where craftsmanship creativity thrive, we have a responsibility to open doors for talents from all backgrounds. Because true innovation happens when diverse perspective collide.

##### Three pillars OF INCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP
At LVMH, we believe every person deserves *respect*, *dignity* and *fairness*. No exceptions. We are committed to making sure everyone, no matter their background, feels valued and empowered to contribute. Our APAC strategy aligns with our global vision but adapts to local nuances, driven by three pillars.
- Capability: equipping leaders to champion inclusion, because change starts at the top.
- Talents: we are talent makers, especially focusing on further elevating women and local talents.
- Culture: inclusion is not just a program, it is how we embed respect in everything we do, every day.

At LVMH, Diversity & Inclusion is not "nice to have". It is the key to staying in a region that is rewriting the rules of luxury.

##### Regional D&I INITIATIVES
One initiative I am proud of recently is our Culture Respect Workshops series. It has trained over 900 leaders using case studies and role plays in the workplace to identify disrespectful behaviors and speak up with confidence and model behaviors, that safeguard the Group's culture.

The magic happened when we united for a *common goal*: *collective vision* and *local action* to drive change at scale. When a client advisor in Seoul or a designer in Shanghai feels empowered to speak up, that is when we know it is working.

##### The role of EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS
Our Employee Resource Groups are where passion meets purpose. Think of them as grassroots communities, led by employees and for employees. Employee Resource Groups play a crucial role in
- Promoting **inclusion**
- Fostering a **diverse workplace culture**
- Driving **positive change** within the organization

In Asia Pacific, our 16 ERG chapters across disability, EllesVMH and ALL LVMH Pride are driving real impact by curating various initiatives throughout the year. For example, our EllesVMH Communities host a regular Breakfast Meeting series with senior female leaders to provide career mentorship, as well as sponsorship for talents across Maisons and markets. Our Disability Inclusion Community facilitates disability etiquette workshops to equip employees with knowledge and skills to interact effectively with colleagues who have disabilities.

Those are not just "feel-good" projects. They serve as a forum for problem-solving and innovation while offering support, understanding and connectivity.

##### Partnership FOSTERING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Our focus on Diversity & Inclusion extends to a much broader community and society. We cannot do all this alone. How we do business, engage with community, and partner with organizations matters, and will ultimately influence our communities at large.

For example, in Hong Kong, our talents mentor students from underserved schools with Inspiring Girls. In Singapore, we collaborate with SG Enable to make the workplace more accessible for all. These *partnerships* remind us that luxury is not just about what we create; it is about the *legacy we leave in our communities*.

##### The future of D&I IN ASIA PACIFIC
The future of Diversity & Inclusion in the luxury industry in Asia Pacific hinges on two words: authentic representation. APAC is home to the world's most dynamic, young and digitally savvy consumers. Gen Z and millennial consumers here, they do not just buy products; they buy values.

Culturally, Asia is not a monolith. Each market has unique traditions, beauty standards and values. One critical opportunity is to equip teams with culture intelligence to ensure clienteling and in-store experience represent authentically, from Bangkok to Chengdu.

Our opportunity? To redefine "luxury" as an industry with every talent and every consumer feels seen. My ambition? For LVMH Asia Pacific, to be the gold standard for inclusive luxury. That means we need to be even more intentional and persistent.
- Baking Diversity & Inclusion into the **entire talent cycle**, from hiring to succession planning.
- Accelerating representation at the **senior-level**, elevating **women and local talents** into creative and decision-making roles.
- Leveraging **luxury as a force for change**, scaling partnerships with universities and community organizations by providing access to opportunities to nurture the next generation of diverse talent.

To me, Diversity & Inclusion is crafting a haute couture piece; it requires intention, precision and heart. At LVMH, we are not just building a more inclusive business; we are shaping a more inclusive world. And that is a legacy worth creating.

#### Supporting employment of people with disabilities
**The head of the Group's Disability Inclusion Office, Jean-Rémy Touze,** shares his insights into promoting the employment and integration of people with disabilities at LVMH.

Steadfast in the commitment to integrating people with disabilities in the workplace, LVMH has launched an inclusive program to enhance accessibility, recruit people with disabilities and provide them with the support that enables them to best perform at work. The Group values the unique contributions of people with disabilities to the legacy of excellence championed by its Maisons.

In 2021, LVMH signed the International Labour Organization (ILO) Global Business & Disability Network Charter and fixed a target of increasing the percentage of people with disabilities in its global workforce to 2% by 2025. We were at 1% in 2020. The target is to double the number of employees with disability globally by 2025.

In the following article, you will deep dive into the importance of the Disability Inclusion topic with **Jean-Rémy Touze, from LVMH's Disability Inclusion Office**.

**What are the key roles of Disability Inclusion?**

**Jean-Rémy:** Some of the key roles of Disability Inclusion at LVMH are:

- Ensuring that disability issues are addressed by teams at all levels and in all countries
- Improving understanding of the situation in each geography
- Identifying local challenges for people with disabilities and facilitate communication among our HR teams worldwide
- Helping the Maisons implement global disability policies while also supporting them in the development of local programs

**What are the effective actions?**

**Jean-Rémy:** Some great programs have been introduced in several countries on a local basis. The aim now is to expand the scope, so we are trying to provide the Maisons with a methodology for replicating these initiatives elsewhere and widespread the implementation of these programs.

An initiative began at Sephora in the **United States** in 2017. Over a period of just a few years, Sephora USA increased the percentage of employees with disabilities in its distribution centres to 10% while also achieving a very good productivity rate.

In **France**, a work-linked training program was launched to promote the ongoing professional development of people with disabilities. Since 2014, 102 people with disabilities have been offered a work-linked training contract at the Group's Maisons.

##### Beyond disabilities by Tucker
Based upon the success we have found hiring individuals with disabilities, I truly believe any and every business can benefit from this program.

LOOKING BEYOND *DISABILITIES*

SEPHORA U.S. DISTRIBUTION CENTRE *AIMING FOR 30% OF INCLUSION*

I am the general manager of this beautiful distribution centre that we refer to as the WDC. So we do have a goal of hiring 30% of our full-time individuals and employees with people who have disabilities. We have been live and operating for about 2.5 years and that has allowed us to achieve roughly 38 full-time heads which is roughly 15-16% of our overall full-time head count. I had some skepticism coming into this role but ultimately the excitement outweighed those uncertainties.

The primary focus of the program is that we partner with the State and with the State we have a 9-week training program which gives the individual with the disability with the State and with the State we have a 9-week training program which gives the individual with the disability more time to learn our core job functions in distribution centres. And if we see the need for a reasonable accommodation we will put that in place. Right now our accommodations are geared mainly toward our deaf associates. But we have had to do things like put visuals up for someone on their picking cart or give noise-canceling headphones in certain areas. And then as long as someone is successful they will automatically get a full-time spot at Sephora, earning equal pay for equal work.

My counselor, he was really instrumental to get me this job. We can pay our bills and have a few bucks extra to be comfortable. I never dreamed that this would ever, ever happen!

We find, here at Sephora, that these individuals who have disabilities are incredibly performance-driven. Because they are very focused, they are very appreciative of the opportunity that Sephora has afforded them, that unfortunately many other companies do not afford them. It is actually quite astonishing to see the entire population of a distribution centre of this size really come together and rally around the incredible DNA that program has. I think without this program, we would be a distribution centre shipping products. But with this program it is something so much more than that.

##### Beyond disabilities by Fatima
If someone had told me "Fatima, in 2021, you will be working for the Samaritaine," I would never have believed them.

LOOKING BEYOND *DISABILITIES*

LA SAMARITAINE *REVEALING TALENTS*

I joined the LVMH Group in 2016 with a professional training contract, that I got through an employment agency. I am deaf in my left ear. I prefer to tell people upfront about my disability, that way I can better understand instructions and follow everything that is being said. I have to be as alert as possible.

The LVMH apprenticeship inclusive program for people with disabilities was launched in 2014 by our CSR department. Its goal is to train them to work as sales consultants and stock managers. The people in this program are not recruited on the basis of their resume, it is not a "regular recruitment". We like to focus more on their overall potential. That is why their 2 years of apprenticeship are critical. They help individuals get used to their work environment and gain confidence.

Going back to school was a real struggle. But at 40 I finally got a professional diploma. I am very proud of myself. I see this as a great victory.

Fatima is a wonderful example of success. 5 years ago, she had very little confidence in herself, she was afraid of talking about her disability because she was scared of being discriminated against. Today she is fulfilled and a fully integrated member of our team. We are really proud to have her onboard.

It is a Maison that makes you feel valued, that gives you confidence. Being employed on a long-term contract at the age of 44, I can at last breath a sigh of relief.

**How does LVMH create attractive career opportunities?**

**Jean-Rémy:** In developed countries, individuals with disabilities have 50% less chance on average, of obtaining a degree. Work study programs can help close that gap and create attractive career opportunities.
Another noteworthy initiative, relating to high-level disabilities, is the project undertaken with the French non-profit "Vivre et Travailler Autrement". The aim is to integrate people with severe autism – who have difficulty with things like speaking and reading – into the manufacturing teams at the Guerlain plant in Chartres.

**How do you overcome biases?**

**Jean-Rémy:** More than 2,700 employees with disabilities already contribute to the excellence achieved by our Maisons in a wide variety of functions, including customer experience.

To change the way people see disability, we need to overcome persistent stereotypes and misconceptions. Some people still believe, for example, that luxury goods and disabilities are incompatible. However, at LVMH, an employee with disability is not limited to a specific area and could work in a store, a workshop or an office, just as they might hold a management position or be at the very start of their career.

**How does the Group support the community of people with disabilities?**

**Jean-Rémy:** LVMH is committed to ensuring that disability does not constitute a barrier to recruitment, promotion or talent development, and should be normalized.
The Group is honoured to work with impactful partners to support this community. LVMH supports Runway of Dreams, a non-profit organization that works towards the inclusion of people with disabilities in the fashion industry.

People with disabilities make up 15% of the global population. Disability is therefore an ordinary part of life – of our lives!

### Preserving unique savoir-faire
#### Passing on our savoir-faire to all generations
LVMH and its Maisons are the **custodians of an unparalleled heritage of time-honoured craftsmanship and creative skills** and take great care in **protecting and developing savoir-faire** that has sometimes been passed on for centuries.

**Preserving these métiers and their traditions** is essential to the enduring success of LVMH. The skills of our artisans guarantee the **excellence** that goes into crafting our products and experiences. This savoir-faire constitutes a unique, intangible heritage that lies at the heart of our appeal and aura around the world. This can be professions such as formulation technician, winegrower, seamstress, leather craftsman or Client Advisor.

We call these exceptional skills the "LVMH Métiers d'Excellence" that encompass more than **280 professions**, that have a very promising future, in which people can grow, pursue fulfilling careers and explore new territories. It aims to create a **virtuous circle of initiatives** that unites all LVMH Maisons and all generations around the essential goal of passing on savoir-faire.

Discover an overview of the 4 Métiers d'Excellence initiatives on the next cards.

There are gestures you learn. Others you pass down. And some you must protect.

A few years ago, Benjamin would never have imagined setting precious stones for the prestigious Maison Chaumet in Paris. Today, he is an apprentice Stone Setter. Every day, he learns patience, precision and how to master the perfect gesture.

A few hundred kilometres away, in Rome, Michele holds his brushes with the confidence of a true master. As a Virtuoso Make Up Artist at Sephora, he reveals the beauty in each face and teaches others the right techniques.

Benjamin is just starting out. Michele is already an expert. But they both share the same pride: being part of LVMH's Métiers d'Excellence. Holders of precious savoir-faire that the Group is committed to pass on, value and preserve.

That is exactly why Benjamin took part in the You & ME event in Paris, followed by Michele a few weeks later in Rome. A unique event to discover the savoir-faire of our Maisons and the people behind them. A place where vacations can be revealed and careers can start.

In 2025, the You & ME tour travelled to 6 cities in France and Italy, and welcomed over 10,000 visitors. A tangible sign of how Métiers d'Excellence LVMH is committed to pass on savoir-faire to a new generation of talents.

Benjamin is learning, so he can become an expert. Michele is sharing his skills, so he can train others. And both of them, like 100,000 people working in Métiers d'Excellence around the world, carry a precious savoir-faire.

#### EXCELLENT! PROGRAM
A program to build awareness to new generations and spark vocations in France, Italy, Spain and USA. The LVMH Maisons, through their Human Resources teams and experts, thus engage students in middle schools by leading practical workshops and show that these métiers offer wonderful career opportunities.

#### YOU & ME TOUR
It is a vocational guidance and recruiting fair dedicated to the LVMH Group's array of specialized métiers. This event occurs every year in various cities in France and Italy. It aims to provide professional opportunities to all types of audiences and let them discover and try different Métiers d'Excellence.

#### THE MÉTIERS D'EXCELLENCE INSTITUTE
It is the first vocational training program in the luxury industry with a work-study format. This initiative is committed to protecting and passing on the unique heritage of savoir-faire and craftsmanship skills that make the success of each Maison in the Group.

The Métiers d'Excellence Institute currently offers different courses in Creative, Craft, and Client Experience professions in France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany and USA.

In each training track, students take both technical and theoretical courses at recognised partner schools and universities, combined with on-the-job experience at LVMH Maisons through paid apprenticeship or professional training programs.

The Métiers d'Excellence Institute offers unique masterclasses to their students (discovery, métier, cross-disciplinary, culture) to discover the Maisons and exchange views with experts in the field. In this podcast, Frederic Bodenes, Artistic and Image Director at Le Bon Marché, and Emilie Labarussias, newly promoted Première Main Qualifiée at Atelier Christian Dior Haute Couture Flou, share their experience holding a Masterclass and taking part in the Métiers d'Excellence Institute program, respectively.

#### THE VIRTUOSOS
A community of people whose exceptional savoir-faire are practiced at LVMH Maisons around the world. They endorse this status as a recognition of their expertise and an emblematic career path within the Group. This recognition enables them to take part in Métiers d'Excellence multidisciplinary trainings and activities, but also to pass and promote their profession, transmit their savoir-faire, develop themselves, and gain visibility by becoming an ambassador of their profession and Maison.

### LVMH & ARTS
#### Our commitment to culture & creativity
As the world's leading luxury group, LVMH has a role to play to create exceptional products and share artists' outstanding works, celebrate culture and offer it to the world, inspire dreams, create emotions and raise awareness among all people.

**Supporting art and heritage**

From the beginning of its history, LVMH has demonstrated a unique commitment to philanthropy. The Group and its Maisons support community-oriented initiatives in France and around the world, promoting and maximizing **access to art, cultural heritage, fashion and arts education**.

LVMH is a major supporter of initiatives aimed at preserving France's historic heritage. Thanks to LVMH's exclusive support, Boating Party – painted by Gustave Caillebotte between 1877 and 1878 – has been added to the Musée d'Orsay's permanent collection. The painting – a major work of the artist and of the Impressionist movement as a whole – was recognized as a National Treasure by France's Ministry of Culture in 2020. Its acquisition enriches the Musée d'Orsay's collection of Impressionist paintings with an unequalled masterpiece in France's public collections.

**Fondation Louis Vuitton: A haven for art and culture**

Since it was opened in 2014, the Fondation Louis Vuitton has become one of the world's leading institutions on the international arts scene. In nine years, it has already welcomed nearly **11 million visitors**, reflecting its immense success with French and international museum-goers.

The Fondation Louis Vuitton's core missions are supporting artists and building dialogue between key figures in modern art, leading lights of the international contemporary art scene and a wide audience, especially young people.

### Example of a sustainable Maison
#### Focus on Tiffany & Co.
By now, you have learned more about the various environmental and social commitments within the Group and different Maisons. But in practice, all the Group's Maisons are taking action on environmental and social issues at the same time.

Learn from **Mary Bellai**, Chief Human Resources Officer **at Tiffany & Co.**, about the Maison's two distinct initiatives: **The Tiffany & Co. Foundation**, focused on preserving the environment, and **Tiffany Atrium**, focused on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging.

Hello, my name is Mary Bellai and I am the Chief Human Resources Officer for Tiffany & Co. In this role, I am responsible for developing and executing the people strategies that support Tiffany's global business plan and growth goals, and that nurture the talents of our over 16,000 employees around the world.

I am proud to say that I have worked at Tiffany for nearly 25 years. I joined Tiffany & Co. in 1999 as a Human Resources Representative. From there, I progressed steadily through a broad range of both specialist and generalist roles in the Global Human Resources Division, spanning corporate, retail and new ventures. In 2013, I took on a global mobility assignment overseeing HR for the Tiffany EMEA region. I was promoted to Vice President in 2017, where I served as the senior HR business partner to the executive leadership of our corporate, creative and operations functions. I was promoted to my current position of CHRO in the summer of 2021, following the acquisition of Tiffany by the LVMH Group.

As with LVMH, at Tiffany we are passionately committed to the idea that **our people make the difference**. And I am honoured to serve as our people leader. At Tiffany & Co., a strong commitment to sustainability and social responsibility are at the heart of everything we do. As a company whose DNA is entwined with the *notion of love*, we feel a special responsibility to care for *our environment and make a difference* in the communities where *we live and work*. Two prominent examples of our social commitments are the Tiffany & Co. Foundation and Tiffany Atrium.

##### THE TIFFANY & CO. FOUNDATION
The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, has a mission to helping to preserve the world's most treasured *seascapes and landscapes*. Since the year 2000, the Foundation has awarded over $100 million in grants to nonprofit organizations working around the world in this capacity.

The Foundation supports organizations and dedicated to the stewardship of natural resources in the areas of responsible mining through mediation and land preservation. As well as coral and marine conservation, through support for marine protected areas, and raising awareness about the importance of coral reefs.

As examples of its work and responsible mining, the Foundation has supported the cleanup of abandoned mines across the American West, and has protected 10 million acres of ecologically rich and culturally significant lands. The foundation has also been instrumental in the reclamation of abandoned diamond mines in Sierra Leone by supporting RESOLVE, an organization that works with local communities to restore these lands for viable agriculture use through the Peace Diamonds Restoration Initiative.

In coral and marine conservation, the Foundation has supported the protection and promotion of coral reefs in over 30 countries around the world, with locations spanning from Hawaii to the Caribbean, Australia and the Coral Triangle. Additionally, the Foundation has supported the creation and implementation of over 30 marine protected areas, protecting more than 11 sq.km., equivalent to the size of the United States across the world's five oceans.

##### Tiffany ATRIUM
Tiffany Atrium is our platform for social impact. Launched in July of 2022, Atrium stems from our deep commitment to *diversity equity, inclusion and belonging*. From its inception, Tiffany has had a profound connection to the arts, creativity and innovative design. In fact, the house established a design apprenticeship program in the 19th century to foster and leverage creative talent.

In recognition of this legacy and our responsibility to the future, Tiffany is committed to *building a more equitable and inclusive jewelry industry*. With a focus on people of colour, women, and the LGBTQIA+ communities in the fine jewelry and creative fields, Atrium guides Tiffany's
- Engagement with diverse communities
- Philanthropic strategies
- Community partnerships
to ensure that all energies and efforts are deeply intentional and bring long lasting and transformative change.

As one example of our Atrium program in action, we recently launched the "Breakfast at Tiffany's" program for those starting out in their careers. It is behind the scenes tour where early career professionals from underrepresented backgrounds can experience Tiffany & Co.'s world class service and get to know the teams behind the brand.

We also engage with our local communities. We have a long standing relationship with the Lower East Side Girls Club to build a career recruitment pipeline. We work with historically black colleges and universities to provide educational and professional opportunities for students in those communities. To date, more than 100 students have received scholarships totaling over $2 million as part of this initiative. We also partner with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to create a curriculum for students in these creative industries.

Craftspeople are a critical part of our business. As such, we have developed an apprenticeship program as part of the LVMH Métiers D'Excellence Institute, where we focus on recruiting and uplifting women and underrepresented groups to this field of work. The apprentices have received thousands of hours of mentoring by our skilled Tiffany craftspeople to better refine their skills and pass on this savoir-faire of jewelry making. After successful programs in New York and Rhode Island, we are looking to expand this program to other parts of the United States and eventually globally.

Tiffany & Co. is
- Committed to being **a leader in Sustainable Luxury**
- Proud of **our achievements to date**
- Continue to expand **our efforts for our planet and for our communities**
