### Creative process
#### Creative Process: a must-have for Designers
**Alice Litscher**, Head Professor of the Master of Arts in Fashion Design, Major in Image, at **L'Institut Français de la Mode**, details each of the three crucial steps of a creative process: **collecting, experimentation and making**.

For a long time, the fashion industry testified to legitimacy of designers by the creative genius. In a postmodern world, where the quest for authenticity contributes to our increasingly fragmented vision, it is urgent to highlight the fundamental nature of the creative process. A clearer creative process is one of the most precious tools a designer can have, thanks to which he or she can function as a professional in the fashion industry at the highest level.

The creative process can be divided into three different phases:
- Collecting
- Experimentation
- Making

The intensity of each phase can be adopted by each individual designer.

Inspiration, which can come from anywhere, reaches the designer only through the personal filter of the creative universe, the one that gives them a particular vision. It could be related to childhood or to other human beings, people so important in the designer's life, we can call them muses. It can also be a particular attention to gesture, movement or to certain artistic fields, such as architecture or music, or even a social event or historical moment.

The action that will determine how the inspiration will influence the design is *collecting*: this is the first concrete step in the creative process. It could be a collection of images found on the Internet, in libraries or from magazines. It could be a collection of words, ideas, stories, objects, colours or materials. The collection establishes the vocabulary, the raw material of design. 

*Experimentation* is a transformation of the results of the collecting, sometimes in a very playful way. At that time, it is not consistent to think about the product or archetype of what designers are supposed to create. This is the moment for *innovation*: the time for happy accidents. How can we link inspiration to the dress and body? It can be a kind of automatic writing, an alchemy, even a scientific process with a protocol: time to drape, dye, cut, scale, to make collages, return, undo, draw, redo, despair, find, choose, sort, modulate, draw, draw and draw again. This is a key moment - the transformation, transmutation of inspiration into something else.

Finally, the third period comes: the research from the two previous phases must be drafted into **reality**. We should connect the disparate elements, details, finishings, fabrics, silhouettes. It is time to make pattern, to work hand in hand with craftsmen, to adapt to technical or financial limits. It is the landing of the designer. If the two first steps can have variable importance from one designer to another, this last step is not optional. Confronting your desire to the real world is what you commit to by working in the fashion industry.

You may be wondering why you should analyze or know the designer's creative process. If you decide to work in the fashion industry, you will work with collaborators. You will have to communicate with them at different stages of the creative process. Knowing **the creative process** in detail will allow you to find your place in a team, to know what to delegate or ask to whom and when at the right time, or even bring people together around your project.

Designers, after taking the time to analyze, make your creative process visible, be able to formulate the order of the different steps of your own creative process. Make a diagram which will be your contacts, your map, and which will make you more effective in times of turbulence and doubt. Managers take care of this map, respect it, take it into account to guide your relationship with creative people.

Designing in the fashion industry is to transform the world a little, thanks to the world of the designer. And exactly like all magic tricks, there is a very special secret only known by you. 

### Creative Design and the ASCEND Framework
#### Learn about the common path to Creativity
Join **Thomaï Serdari**, Professor of Marketing and Director of the Fashion and Luxury MBA at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, **New York University**, as she explains **ASCEND, a framework she designed to organise our understanding of creativity.**

She maintains that the most **successful luxury companies uphold their advantage in the market because creativity is at the core of their strategic planning**.

For Thomaï Serdari, **all creatives can take their designs to the next level of innovation by focusing the beginning of their design process on the field of the Arts**, where abstract and philosophical ideas offer an unlimited potential of applied solutions and brand differentiation.

Hello. My name is Thomaï Serdari and I am a professor of luxury marketing at the Stern School of Business, New York University where I am also the Director of the Fashion & Luxury MBA degree. I have been formally studying *the luxury markets* since 2008, although my earlier career in *design* and *art* is definitely the foundation of my current academic work.

##### The ASCEND *Framework*
This framework is called ASCEND, based on the four distinct fields of which it consists:
- Arts
- Science
- Engineering
- Design

and the clockwise motion through which ideas become things.

##### Example of a Famous Creative: *Louis Vuitton*
Let me present to you a fundamental concept that clearly illustrates how this *framework works* before we return to our examination of the field of fashion and product design. Let us go back to the time of Louis Vuitton. Until his time, people were traveling by horseback carriages. The idea of travel was a familiar concept, but it was also a challenge that had to be mastered. How to travel *faster*, *easier*, *further*? These were some of the questions that occupied the popular imagination as well as the imagination of young Louis.

As an idea, travel belongs to the first field of the framework:
1. *The Arts*: Travel as an abstract question. That is until knowledge advanced and allowed the science of physics to be applied in creating engines that could sustain long periods of motor movement.
2. *Science*: Science led to better engineering.
3. *Engineering*: With the help of design, new and fast locomotives changed the nature of travel.
4. *Design*: Louis realized there was an opportunity to design a new type of luggage that made travel even more comfortable and that ensures the transfer of personal goods in a convenient and safe way. And so the stackable *Louis Vuitton* trunks were invented.

Let us now return to fashion design and the work of Charles James. For him, artistic inspiration was based on his quest to *empower women*, as they were allowed to make public appearances on their own, to facilitate their movement literally, as they were not judged for leaving their home during the day and hopped into taxis to get to social or cultural events. He invented the elastic waist that made skirts and dresses less constricting and more comfortable. He also came up with the idea of the theatre dress designed asymmetrically around the figure, a cut diagonally across the torso to allow the wearer to take it on and off easily.

##### Art and Inspiration *Today*
Are the arts still an inspiration to *innovative designers* today? Absolutely! Can they propel *creativity* to the next level of novelty that makes luxury brands the trendsetters in their industry? *Without a doubt*.

Reviews of the Spring-Summer Louis Vuitton collection, designed by the then newly appointed artistic director Virgil Abloh, applauded the designer's unabated use of colour and embraced the vocabulary Abloh created specifically for the runway show. As Max Grobe of the magazine Highsnobiety reported, "under 'R', the designer defined rainbow as *a kaleidoscopic palette* evolving from off-white to polychromatic," "synchronously forming a holograph archway known to represent a dream."

Fascinated by the idea of space travel and discovery, Abloh was hinting at a futuristic space age-inspired *contemporary design* that he materialized on the catwalk with having asked Playboi Carti, the popular rapper from Atlanta, to close the show in a silvery foiled cape and an iridescent version of Louis Vuitton's classic Keepall bag.

In other words, Abloh used his own *artistic curiosity* about how space exploration was evolving at the time to introject elements of space travel into the design of new fashion items and the redesign of celebrated staples that bear the Louis Vuitton signature.

### AI in the Creation process
#### The role of AI in luxury markets
In this video, **Emanuela Prandelli**, LVMH Associate Professor at **Bocconi University**, explores how **Artificial Intelligence can help luxury brands reconnect with aspirational customers** while continuing to nurture relationships with their Very Important Clients (VICs).

Hello, I am Emanuela Prandelli and I have the privilege to be the LVMH Associate Professor of Fashion and Luxury Management, at Bocconi University. The luxury market has recently undergone a significant transformation in its own structure. What was once a classic pyramidal configuration, with a broad base and a narrow tip, has now evolved into a kind of hourglass shape, characterized by an increasing polarization of consumption.

This shift is driven by consumer trends toward "mix and match" combining items from different brands and price ranges and it has been exacerbated by economic pressures, such as high interest rates and accelerated inflation, which have eroded the purchasing power of many consumers. While aspirational customers have been *pushed downwards*, leading them to seek *more affordable options* the high-end consumers have remained *largely unaffected* by the *economic downturn*, reinforcing the gap between the two groups.

Consequently, luxury brands are increasingly dependent on this small percentage of clients, the so-called 1%, who contribute to the majority of revenues and require tailored attention to maintain their loyalty. By focusing on Very Important Clients (VICs) showing the lowest price elasticity, many brands have shifted their focus away from aspirational customers, who have, in turn, redirected their spending towards experiences and the second-hand market.

The imperative question becomes: How can luxury reconnect with aspirational customers while continuing to nurture the relationships with VICs? How can Artificial Intelligence play a role in this process? And the answer comes quite straightforward: luxury brands know personally all the VICs and they already offer them unique, amazing, human-enhanced customized experiences. But aspirational customers are many more and much more diversified. Artificial Intelligence can help bring *personalized content, experiences and value propositions* to this larger *cohort of consumers*, that cannot be neglected to guarantee a healthy development of the industry over time.

##### The Power of AI-ENHANCED CRM
A first opportunity to rely on AI lies exactly in enhancing CRM, Customer Relationship Management. Predictive AI can boost *upselling* and *cross-selling*, translating directly into *revenue gain*. Personalized recommendations and tailored experiences, which are aligned with individual customer preferences and history of purchases, can raise the consumers' willingness to buy and increase their average transaction value.

In an era of *granular customer data* for companies and *overwhelming product information* for consumers, AI's major role is *simplifying* the *purchase process* and *reducing decision fatigue*. McKinsey and Business of Fashion reveal that 75% of consumers abandon online purchases due to choice overload, and 80% cite dissatisfaction with search tools as a barrier to purchase.

By relying on AI-powered conversational shopping tools, brands can not only better filter content and deliver more targeted messages, but also engage even the large cohort of aspirational consumers in more customized experiences, from:
- Virtual catwalk
- Try-on technology
- Personal avatar
- Gamified interaction

At its most advanced, AI could enable safe configuration of products, allowing consumers to combine products from a predefined menu, enhancing not only sales but also margins.

##### Utilizing AI-ENHANCED INVENTORY
A second interesting direction to apply AI in luxury has to do with AI-enhanced inventory and adaptive supply chain management. AI-based algorithms enable to forecast demand more accurately. This predictive ability enables to efficiently manage inventory, reducing the risk of overproduction or stock-outs.

As a result, not only costs are reduced, but also the sustainability of the supply chain is increased, with efficiency gains that go much beyond the limited segment of made-to-measure production. Companies can in this way accelerate and automate in-store replenishment processes and improve inventory management in regional warehouses. In this vein of efficiency gains and commitment towards sustainability, an interesting role can also be played by digital passports, that can help protect businesses, buyers, and sellers from counterfeit goods.

While AI-enhanced CRM and AI-enhanced inventory are rooted into the power of predictive AI, a third fascinating area of AI development in luxury also involves design and creativity.

##### Generative AI's Potential IN DESIGN AND CREATIVITY
This is the field where generative AI is starting to show its potential, from enabling fully AI-generated advertising campaigns, to supporting creativity and designers to facilitating archive searches and contributing to generate additional inputs for new product development.

Luxury products have always represented the quintessential expression of the creativity of very distinguished designers, interpreting the brand DNA and being every season challenged by the very subtle game of carefully balancing respect for its heritage and systematic innovation. To project the past into the future and make new collections, culturally relevant for new communities of consumers.

In more recent times, however, AI has come to play a potentially interesting role in *fueling with new inputs this restless creative effort*. To explore this field, we have run an interesting experiment, by bringing together a company that hosts a co-creation digital platform for fashion design, a luxury fashion brand which committed to manufacture and sell the products emerging from the search, and a leading technology company providing us AI tools.

During this real-world, multi-year project, we ended up by developing four t-shirts: two designed by human designers, winners of the co-creation platform, and other two generated by AI, analyzing non-winning submissions, to explore if it is possible to extract any additional value from ideas that would have been simply discarded otherwise.

What we discovered is pretty interesting. First, when brought on the shelves of both *physical* and *digital stores*, without revealing the *underlying source of design*, *the AI-designed t-shirts outsold the human-designed ones* by more than double. The primary insight was quite unexpected: the AI-supported designs were perceived by consumers as *more consistent* with the brand DNA and its *visual codes*, demonstrating that AI's focus on commonalities can result in more conservative outcomes.

However, in a research lab setting, when consumers were aware of the design source, their preferences significantly shifted, dissipating the AI t-shirts' advantage. This means that AI's involvement in luxury product design is perceived as an erosion of the designers' expertise. In brief, consumers appeared to *appreciate* the AI-designed t-shirts *only* when they were *unaware of the design source*, but not when the source of the design was made salient to them. 

Overall,
- This research demonstrates how AI can **extract additional value from crowdsourced creative ideas**.
- The non-winning designs submitted to the co-creation contest were leveraged to create AI-supported products that **show potential on store shelves**, but this effect was evident **only when consumers were blind to the design source**.

In other words, luxury consumers did not seem to like the idea that their dreamy pieces were designed by AI. This combined evidence highlights the interesting complementary role that AI can currently play in **supporting creative activities** in the luxury sector, while still being **far from replacing human creativity**, especially if a brand aims to **preserve the desirability** that drives luxury customer preferences.

Thank you so much for listening to these few ideas. I hope that you might share the same passion for both the digital and the luxury and their amazing points of connections.

## CREATION & DESIGN AT LVMH
### 360° discovery of Creation at LVMH
Discover how creation is at the heart of our Maisons' daily activities.

#### BVLGARI
##### Behind the scenes of a BVLGARI watch
**Fabrizio Buonamassa, Bvlgari's** Watches Creative Director, explains the design process of creating unique, simple, and yet iconic products.

###### What is Design
Let us start from the word "design". It amazes me how the extensive Italian vocabulary does not have a word to define this concept. We believe engineering to be too cold and art too unregulated. So when we say "design" we mean "**art applied to industry**". This speaks volumes on how Italians regard this profession which is a mix of several professions.

It is about emotions because Inspiration often comes from emotions. But we will talk about the creative process later. The designer's ultimate aim is to improve the quality of life with the products he or she designs. It is not a one man show. A team is required to turn the designer's vision into *a real product*.

Take this pen for instance, it is a simple object but I believe it is so important as Design sample because even to just remove a single component from this simple product more than two years of development were needed. This somewhat explains the work behind a design process even of what may be a simple object. So, imagine what happens when conceiving a watch as highly complex as Ours, like the Octo Finissimo or jewellery products.

###### The creative *process*
The *creative process* is the true mystery behind the product, each designer has his own. Personally what I mostly do is draw. I started at four or five and I do not think I have ever stopped. I always draw then I am in a meeting or on the phone when I am being interviewed. It is my way of expressing my creativity.

I start by drawing, I draw a lot I end up with 200 or 300 page notepads full of drawings. It is amazing how sometimes you start drawing your idea... ending up somewhere completely different. That is the true mystery because when I first come up with something I need to draw it to bind it on paper because if it slips my mind... it is gone forever. But also to figure out where this idea is going.

At first the idea is really fragile. It is intimate and private. I do not even show the drawings. I show item once the idea is **more solid** that is when you show someone, when the idea starts developing, thanks to manufacturing, marketing and product development which turn a simple sketch, a simple idea into a real object. 

###### Bvlgari, *Roman-inspired creativity*
It is the only jewellery and watchmaker Brand born, raised and living in Rome. So Italian style is as much a source of inspiration as is Roman style. The concept of beauty for Italians is completely different from other nations. *Beauty* for Italians is absolutely necessary. It is part of our lives.

Being an unordinary Brand, we do not view the archive as a place to look for ideas, but as an opportunity to reinvent the Brand. If you look at what we have done with Serpenti, we are the only Brand able to apply a sign in so many variations. We have eight new ways to wear the Serpenti and this is only regarding watches, in jewellery there are even more.

This is what we love: *reinventing* the Brand time and again trying to be precise about the roots and DNA of the brand. This is a great source of inspiration. This is a truly unique Brand. The design I try to express, and we try to convey with our products is hopefully just as unique, simple and iconic. 

###### Quiz
According to Fabrizio Buonamassa, how is design defined both generally and specifically at Bvlgari?

- [x] Using the past to reinvent the brand
- [x] Improving the quality of life through the products

#### HUBLOT
##### HUBLOT'S REINVENTION OF TRADITIONAL WATCHMAKING
A thrilling name for collectors and watchmaking connoisseurs alike, **Hublot** wields the **art of the unconventional**.
Founded in 1980, the Maison bridges audacity, tradition and innovation, all in a day's work. **Emmanuel Missillier**, Industrialisation Manager, and **Patrick Cibien**, Technical Director of Movements, lift the veil on what it takes to birth desirable yet wearable timepieces that continue to defy convention.

###### A glimpse into a day of a Watchmaker at Hublot
Watchmaking enthusiasts will agree that a timepiece contains a universe of miniaturization and precision. Hublot's "**manufacture movement**" channels the many know-hows within the Maison. It is entirely designed, produced and assembled in-house and most of the components and cases are produced on-site.

Far from the age-old image of the lonely watchmaker tinkering away in his workshop, a regular day at Hublot involves **interacting with many different colleagues**. Patrick Cibien describes daily interactions this way:

> *"We are in constant interaction with the manufacturing and product departments... Every day is full of exchanges with the whole company. A typical work day does not exist at Hublot."*

**The design and laboratory units reflect the watchmaking process** from ideation and prototyping to function optimization, product approval and manufacturing. The two teams are responsible for every single Hublot watch that comes to life.

> *"A movement is born from the close collaboration between these two teams, from their permanent dialogue, in the desire to constantly perfect the product."*

###### How to tackle the challenges of modern watchmaking?
**Quality and continuous improvement** are at the forefront of Hublot's mission. A large part of fine watchmaking revolves around efficiency and optimization. The laboratory evaluates each design for functionality and longevity. However, **the real test happens once the watch reaches its owner's wrist**, this phase of live observation is an integral part of product development. There are many parameters to balance in the product development process, and each stakeholder holds a different perspective.

Hublot is a verticalized Maison where all the essential trades of watchmaking are brought together under one roof. This means that **collaboration is key and that each team member typically juggles several projects at once**. Hublot is always working on multiple different designs while striving to improve on the existing models. This is reflected in the responsibilities for each role, which Patrick Cibien describes as a trifecta of skills:

> *"Designer, draftsman and project manager, a single person holds these three functions at Hublot. Six to thirteen years of seniority are common, experience is important in our sector."*

About forty movement studies have been finalized so far, and the Hublot teams are already working on projects that will come out in two or three years, perhaps later.

###### When heritage meets innovative ambition
At only 42 years old, Hublot holds an unfettered dynamism and seeks to **reinterpret technical watchmaking in a modern way**, always looking towards the future.

Hublot's range of watches combines technical feats, efficient production processes and desirability. The Maison constantly strives to develop a **coherent yet innovative product line**. So, it is a case of striking an **ideal balance between a feasible product and an attractive one**.

> *"The vitality of the factory and its ability to constantly offer modern products is pulling us in that direction."*

One or two years of preparation are necessary to create a mechanical movement, from the draft to the production process. This relatively quick turn-around time in the art of watchmaking is due to the Maison's youth. "It is an art, a craft that has existed for 350 years and is constantly changing," summarizes Emmanuel Missillier.

###### Why pursue a career in watchmaking?
> *"I love the creative and technical side of design, doing different things, pushing innovation and the fact that we are different."*

Patrick Cibien, who was born in a family of watchmakers, considers being a watchmaker a big part of his life's balance.

Watchmaking is a career that is not often considered but is intensely in demand. Working with hand-made products carries a romantic aspect in comparison to a typical desk job and the necessary skills to become successful in this trade are some that many possess. Soft skills such as **problem-solving, patience and discipline paired with being creative and curious** are beneficial for aspiring watchmakers. It is essential to think outside of the box and envision the future of a centuries-old profession. As a seasoned watchmaker, Emmanuel Missillier showcases these skills through his passion for mechanical techniques. He considers the Maison's mission of taking watchmaking into the future as a unique asset:

> *"Offering new innovations is a watchmaker's daily role in the laboratory. A watch movement is a marvel of mechanics, some parts measuring a few tenths of a millimeter; at the end of the chain, they must interact with each other. This tiny world is a source of wonder. At Hublot, we work with state-of-the-art devices and tools to reinvent it."*

###### To Conclude...
Beyond Watchmaking, Hublot offers endless opportunities across multiple job fields. Teams are always looking for new professionals to join their Maison from Engineers, Technical Managers, to Project Managers alike!

###### Quiz

- [x] Teams constantly work together and juggle several projects

#### LOUIS VUITTON
##### LEATHER GOODS DESIGN AT LOUIS VUITTON: UNLIMITED CREATIONS
From designing **Louis Vuitton**'s trunk collection to working on fashion pieces for the catwalk, Louis Vuitton's Senior Leather Goods Designer, **Sigrid**, gives the lowdown on her day-to-day activities, and on how every project starts with research and sketches.

Since the recording of the video, Sigrid has been promoted to Head of Design.

###### Can you tell us *about Louis Vuitton's history*?
Mister Louis Vuitton was a super talented product designer, because he invented new luggages for the emerging new travel activities at the end of the 1800s. 

###### What do you do *as a Leather Goods Designer*?
My job consists in designing the current trunk collection. I work also on the showpieces for the men's show and for the women show, four times a year. For the trunks, we have the permanent collection and then we have also special orders. The client can order his one-and-only personalised trunk and we guide him and we make the designs for him, and then he can have his individual trunk. An interesting part for our work is also to have the collaborations with artists or with famous clients.

###### How do *your project start*?
Every project starts with researching. Quite quickly, I do sketches and drawings, because it is really important to check, straightaway, the proportions as we work on the interiors and the exterior shape at the same time. Then I have a look at the materials: the metal pieces and the montage. And also this actually makes the first prototype.

###### What is Louis Vuitton's *design approach*?
The great thing at Louis Vuitton is the wide range of products, with the leather goods, the trunks, the ready-to-wear, the shoes, the jewellery, the perfumes... There is a really strong design approach. And there are bridges between all these products. It seems that the creation is unlimited.

###### Any advice *for the next generation*?
My advice for you is to love your project and believe in it. And do not do things because you think they are expected. 

###### Quiz
Why does the Maison offer unlimited potential for creation?
- [ ] It reinvents itself with each product.
- [x] It offers a wide range of products with a strong design approach
- [ ] One designer alone is entirely free to create their product

##### DISCOVER THE VISUAL IMAGE STUDIO
Let us look into the creation of windows, events and runway shows at **Louis Vuitton**!

**Ansel Thompson**, Art Director of the Visual Image Studio, shares with us his job and challenges, his creative process and how at Louis Vuitton creativity and sustainability are linked.

###### What is your role at Louis Vuitton's Visual Image Studio and could you describe your creative process?
The Visual Image Studio is responsible for all of Louis Vuitton's store windows worldwide; there are currently 460 Louis Vuitton network windows all over the world and 14 Maisons or flagship stores. The Studio also ideates, creates and produces other three-dimensional projects, including brand elements such as **exhibitions, runway shows, temporary spaces, digital projects, and facades**.

Our process starts with **collaboration and creative freedom** we are really fortunate for not having rules regarding the creative process, so we approach all of our projects in different ways. For example, an idea may originate from something we find in a flea market or bookstore. We travel a lot when we can, and we work closely with our communications, product, marketing and digital as well as the local store teams along the design process, as this can enable projects to develop in a wider variety of directions.

Ultimately, we aim to deliver work that is consistent and extremely sharp in its outcome so that, no matter where a client travels in the world, they have a qualitative and exciting experience with the brand.

We work in a variety of ways that stimulate the **creative and development process**. Whether that is through the use of mood boards, which is a great way to move away from a blank page, through to modelling, illustration and rapid prototyping. Sometimes we will work three-dimensionally and occasionally move straight to a digital means of development, although ultimately, concepts are developed through discussions with our team.

###### Which has been the most memorable of all your schemes for Louis Vuitton?
We always tend to think of the most recent as the most exciting! However, thinking of past schemes, one of them has to be a scheme we produced in conjunction with Frank Gehry a few years ago.

Gehry is someone who we had always admired and was incredibly collaborative and very generous with his time, enthusiastic about the project and welcomed us with open arms. We spent a lot of time in his studio in Santa Monica in Los Angeles, which was the most inspiring and amazing place to be.

We usually work about **a year in advance of installation**. Some schemes take a bit more time to develop, and others happen quite quickly. We find, some projects take a little more time to develop, and other projects will go on hold until it is the right time for the brand. Timing is everything for a brand such as Louis Vuitton, although we are quite intuitive when it comes to knowing when a project feels right for us. Being a fashion company rather than purely leather goods, we have to be **a little more reactive**, therefore fashion shows, which happen in October, will lead to a scheme for the following February, so the turnaround is only three months. Hence, we have to react to the themes of the shows twice a year.

###### Why collaborate with various artists and designers? Are the windows the key element of the store?
Not every brand or design studio has the opportunity to work with such incredible Artists and Designers. We have, of course worked with famous Artists such as Yayoi Kusama, Jeff Koons and Sol Lewitt who have incredible background stories. We do also work with much younger Artists and Designers too. It is so important for us to engage with external partners across the Arts, as it helps to **inject a different kind of feel to the brand**.

I think we have been trying to design our way in and out of the windows. We know that they are important as windows are wonderful places to **showcase emotions**, to **engage clients** and to **make the city a bit more of an interesting place to be**. We do play with them, we push the boundaries, and we love to dare!

###### How do you manage to deliver such consistency across all your stores internationally?
Every store is **drawn digitally**, and all of our designers work three-dimensionally with Computer Aided Design drawings, so that all of our stores are modelled as a digital space.

Every project we work on, whether a window or a façade, for example, has been **produced digitally in advance**, as not all stores are architecturally the same size and shape. Furthermore, we aim at **working closely with local markets** and we do our best to source the producers with the right know-how to produce our schemes locally. This network is growing constantly, yet we do have very high standards and, as we produce everything digitally in 3-D, there is no margin of error.

We also split the stores into what we call **network stores and Maisons**. The network stores are the smaller stores and the Maisons are the sites such as the ones on the Champs Elysées Paris, 5th Avenue, New York, Plaza 66, Shanghai, New Bond Street, London and Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills and then we have our store in Paris at Place Vendome which we treat slightly differently. This one is where we test ideas, where we might add a scheme to be tried out.

###### How is sustainability at the heart of your design and production process?
Louis Vuitton products are designed to last. At every stage of the creative process, we analyse the **environmental impact** of our creations **throughout their entire life-cycle**, constantly challenging ourselves to find creative solutions. We do this in a variety of ways: by **reusing existing materials** for the creation of window schemes, by **reusing previous schemes** in new incarnations and by constantly **questioning materials and production techniques**.

To give you some examples, in the last two years we have created a scheme which was inspired by, and re-used elements from the ready-to-wear show; another that used surplus leather from the patrimoine; for our Shoal of Fish window we worked with Parley for The Oceans to use sustainably sourced materials for production in China, and 100% recycled material and 'green' chrome finish for the European production. We have re-used bespoke window creatives in stores from London to Saint Tropez and then from Sydney to California. And our Virgil Abloh mannequins have had their lives extended far beyond a single season by being resprayed, re-purposed and even sold to collectors as art pieces.

Committed to circular creativity, we imagine innovative creative circularities in order to further extend the sustainability of our products. By 2025, 100% of our event and window materials will be reused or recycled.

###### What advice would you give to someone who would like to join your studio?
Be **open to inspiration**, even in unexpected places. Focus on telling great stories in an **engaging way**. Do not limit yourself in your creative process. Whatever you do, do it with joy and authenticity.

###### Quiz

Hi, my name is Reiko Katakura, and I am currently the Studio Director of Leather Goods at Marc Jacobs. I have been with the company for 15 years. I clearly remember before I started here, whenever I walked by our office, I would look inside the lobby and manifest that I would be here someday.

At the time, I was working as a designer in a corporate design company, and it was tough to think I could transition to a smaller, more elevated brand. Luckily, I had worked with someone who made their own transition to Marc Jacobs. And as the brand grew, she called on me to help establish her team to become a larger and more efficient design team. I did not hesitate at this opportunity, and since being hired in 2009, I have not looked back.

My primary function is to understand the *developmental journey* from inception to completion and *executing any necessary tasks* for this to happen. Short of designing the bags, which falls under the responsibilities of the design team. Through strong communication and leadership, I form partnerships with other departments such as:
- Ready-To-Wear (RTW)
- Footwear
- Jewellery
- Artwork Department
- Runway Team
- Merchandising
- Operations
- Press Relations (PR)

to collaborate, influence and drive change for the line.

Due to my prior history as a designer in Ready-to-Wear, I understand the materials, fabrics, components and hardware required to execute product and most importantly, my ability to work independently to prioritize needs for the line helps to push the process forward.

###### From Creation TO FIRST PROTOTYPES STAGES
For the Core line we receive seasonal concepts and direction from the Creative Director and establish what newness to develop for that season. Materials and silhouettes are determined by the Head of Design and the design team to be put into work for first protos. This is where the team gets to be the most *creative*, looking for *inspiration and ideas* to experiment with and hash out.

Things to keep in mind during this process are that **all styles need to be**:
- Brand Right
- Current
- Wearable
- Appealing

One of the best things working at this brand is that with Marc Jacobs at the helm, there is endless inspiration to start with. As we work with him directly on Runway bags, we know the intricate thought process that is behind the collections, and we will take that as a cue to start the commercial line. It is truly one of the best parts of being with this company to work for internationally play designer, and one of the best creatives working in the field today.

Once designs are sent to our overseas factories and while we wait for the prototypes to be made, we continue to work on designs. We make sure they are compatible with Ready-To-Wear, and that we are using the same language of the season. We obtain information about:
- Price
- Artwork
- Materials
- Embellishment

that will best tie back to the concept of the season.

We partner with jewellery on hardware and any charms or components they may be designing then we can utilize. We do work on:
- Handbags
- Small Leather Goods (or SLGs which includes small bags or wallet on a chain)
- Wallets
- Webbing straps
- Chain straps
- Key charms
- Belts

Once prototypes arrive, we *study and correct them* to get to a *better version* of themselves. We have meetings with merchandising to see what items work in the line, and what needs to be changed for marketability. We review cost, material and hardware possibility with the product development team. Because it is round one of seeing the protos, many elements change as we work through the line. We may try other materials and construction as another round of protos are put into work. Depending on current sales, we may add or drop styles to reflect the current market. We review colour and prints again to make sure they are right going forward.

###### Second Prototypes STAGE
The second proto stage is the same as the first, but the bags should be in a more finalized version with fewer changes needed to get to market sample stage. After second protos arrive, colour cards which document all the components necessary to assemble the bag are built. They detail out everything from:
- Materials
- Lining
- Stitch colours
- Edge paint
- Hardware finish
- Interior/exterior label details

that tie back to the designer's tech packages, which includes sketches, measurements and construction details.

This information makes it possible for the factories to gather materials efficiently, to pattern the bags correctly and construct them in a timely manner. While these samples are being made for the *final market*, the stage where buyers come in to *see the line*, we are on to the *next season*, starting the process all over again.

We go through the same process for Outlet product, which is a separate team, so we not only have to keep different seasons in mind, but also different teams' collections, which happens four times a year.

Another element of the creative process is that twice a year we also work with Marc Jacobs on Runway bags. Although a much smaller collection, the expectations of developing this product are very high as we use luxury materials, higher quality and generated at a much shorter time frame. We have two months max to work through concept, protos, re-protos and finalizing. We work with an atelier in New York. For this the team often works directly at the factory to facilitate at a higher speed. But of course, this process is the icing on the cake as *Runway product are in fashion show* and are viewed by *millions around the world*.

###### From Market to In-store STAGES
Back to the main line, once we receive our final protos for market, they are merchandised in the showroom for internal buyers to look at. We do get feedback from them and still may need to update and implement changes for marketability. It is always a dance between *design intent* and how to *commercialize it*.

The line eventually gets finalized and things move along to production stage, photography for editorial and e-commerce. About nine months later, it is ready for clients to buy and enjoy.

The creative process of designing handbags is a great adventure. From ideas to final product, here are five stages to remember:
1. Creation stage:
	- Reception of **seasonal concept**.
	- **Brainstorm of ideas** to explore.
	- **Sketches** are reviewed and drafted.
	- **Specifications** are detailed.
2. First Prototype Stage:
	- **Bag silhouettes** and **animations** are reviewed.
	- **Alignment of the bags** to the rest of the categories is analyzed.
	- **Cost of materials**, **hardware**, and **production** is scrutinized.
3. Second Prototype Stage:
	- More **finalized prototypes** are reviewed.
	- **Colours of materials** are decided for market proto development.
4. Market Stage:
	- **Final line is presented to buyers** in the showroom for **marketability feedback**.
5. In-store/E-commerce stage:
	- 9 months later **product is ready for clients** to purchase and enjoy.

#### GUERLAIN
##### The Creation of a Perfume
Let us meet the **Master Perfumer behind Guerlain's Perfumes**...

Hear from **Thierry Wasser**, Guerlain Master Perfumer, as he talks about his passion for fragrance. In this podcast, he explains the **perfume-making process**, from his inspiration to the pursuit of finding exceptional raw materials.

LOUISE (interviewer): His name is Wasser, Thierry Wasser, and he has been the nose of Guerlain since 2008. He is a charming man with astonishing old-factory abilities, who is also known to be down to earth, a guy who loves meeting authentic human beings, and I am lucky enough to be sitting right opposite him. Hello, Thierry, how are you?

THIERRY WASSER: I am good, I am the lucky one.

L: Thank you very much, I am feeling great already, this is starting nicely. What fragrance are you wearing today?

T: I wear Habit Rouge, eau de toilette, since I am 13.

L: And why?

T: Oh, that is a long story.

L: Oh, come on, tell us a little bit about that story.

T: Alright… So, when I was 13, at school all my little comrades had little mustaches and little hair on the chin, and I have not. And, you know, kids at that age, or kids generally speaking, are not forgiving. I was not exactly bullied, but, you know, I was marked and pointed out and sorted out because of my baby face. And a friend of my mom, who was a very strong masculine figure for me, was wearing this cologne. And I stole it. **And, believe it or not, but my attitude changed. And eventually my perception changed**. I did not grow any hair in any way, but I was that little man!

L: You still had a baby face but you actually completely changed your attitude.

T: Yeah, but, today - if you have a school reunion with all those ugly kids: they are bald, they have a belly - so that is my revenge. But, at the time, my answer to that was obvious.

L: Okay, and you have stayed with that perfume all the way through?

T: It worked at the time.

L: So it is still working today, right?

T: I do believe so.

L: So I believe you get to travel the world, meeting the most incredible people, producers of all sorts of the different raw materials - absolutely incredible. Would you say you have the best job in the world?

T: Yeah, I strongly believe that.

L: Maybe you can tell us a little, to start with, about some of the amazing people that you have met along your way?

T: Louise, there are so many.

L: I do not know where to start!

T: Yeah, because **each trip - it is its own experience**. And when you do go back year after year, to the same places… you have friends everywhere. And it is very difficult to sort out which friends you like better, but **experiences are basically extensively human**. Because you do not buy jasmine rose or sandalwood, you buy jasmine rose and sandalwood from somebody. And if you do love that somebody, you cannot believe how easy it is to conduct business and to have exactly what your wishes are. I am sure we buy the best sandalwood in the world. I am sure that we have the most beautiful rose in the world **because of those relationships**. Examples?

Well, there is, in the North Australia, where sandalwood is growing, big, giant man who I call 'Santa Claus', because he is bearded, he is big, he is loud, and he is… Santa Claus. And every time I go there, it is like 40 degrees Celsius, the humidity is around a 100 percent or even more, if it exists. And he rolls his own cigarettes. And he said: "Oi mate!"

L: That is a good accent!

T: "You want one?" And he has got such a huge tongue with so much saliva, it is disgusting - that cigarette! But you take it and you smoke it, because he is your friend. And every time I smell sandalwood…

L: "I think of him!"

T: I have got a picture of Santa Claus with this handmade cigarette. Anyway, I do not know, but these human trip, which is constant, it could be in-sourcing trips. But it is in my factory outside Paris, too! You have those characters and that is what makes you believe in what you are doing. So that is… okay, Santa Claus - I mean, I do not know, do they seem stupid, those stories?

L: No, I love it!

T: To me, they matter.

L: They do matter, and I think they matter to anybody who is listening as well. So, let us talk about the creation process: when you actually embark on the **creation process**, where do you start? I mean, where does the inspiration come from?

T: It **comes from everywhere and anywhere**. I think, as a perfume designer, or creator, I am not keen about "creator". It is "designer", or whatever… "perfumer"…

L: Why does it bother you, that word, then?

T: Well, I had once met mister Lagerfeld, who was in front of a crowd, and one person asked him about his way of looking at creation, as a creator. And his answer was: "Only God is the Creator, I am just, you know, designing things on paper". And I do believe the same! So, I would say "designer", I would say "perfumer", but…

L: Okay, so, when you are designing…

T: **Inspiration is, for a designer, about feelings you want to share**. To me, it is a communication tool: you write a formula like you write a story. Then, if you write a story, it is always a little bit, more or less, personal. And if you are not engaged in the moment, if you are not engaged in your life - you live next to your own shoes. How do you want to remember those moments? So, I think **creation comes from little details, little experiences**, that you will be able - when you are back with your creative hat - to recall. And it could be a landscape, it could be Santa Claus, and these cigarettes - it could be a lot of little things which makes you, or triggers in you, the imagination to get the story started. And after it is easy.

L: Okay. Can we maybe take an example - La Petite Robe Noire? In all of our minds, the little black dress is the thing that, like, all women must have in their wardrobe - I mean, it is classy, it is beautiful, it is black. How do you start? I mean, do you sit together as a team and talk about it, or…

T: Well, first of all, you have to **understand where the concept comes from**. And, obviously, I did not come out with a concept as such. Even in my wildest dreams I do not wear little black dresses, right?

L: I do not know, but yes, I think. Just joking, of course.

T: Me too. Because I do! But, so, this concept came out of Ann-Caroline Prazan's, the marketing director for fragrance, head. And, frankly, you say: "Can we invent a fragrance around the concept of the little black dress?" Frankly, you do not get it, you think that marketing people are insane, et cetera, et cetera. But if you think twice, you say: "Huh!", and that is a detail which triggers your imagination. How funny is it for a beauty house to hijack a fashion icon and design a fragrance out of it. And this is, I think, where the sparkle was, and really started the whole process, or the train of thoughts leading to it. Very easy - you said it! Little black dress is black, okay, so what does smell "black"? Go ahead!

L: What smells "black"? I do not know… something with a deep, dark scent to it? Something… I do not know, I am not very specialized in this subject, but a dark…

T: Louise, do not think too much. Alright, I am going to help you out.

L: Yes, help me out, yes.

T: Black cherry, black tea, liquorice - for example. They are black, and, I mean, obviously - as a material, liquorice is black. It is kind of easy but that is how I function - I am not a very complicated man. So, you take cherry, tea, liquorice… then, eventually, something dark, like patchouli, or tonka bean - well, **you have got 5 raw materials which gives you exactly the skeleton of what it is**.

L: I see.

T: And after, as I said before: **you need to recall a memory or you need that sparkle**, and after it goes so easy! And those 5 materials defining the little black dress are what makes **Petite Robe Noire**.

L: When you are designing, because I am not going to use the word "creating" anymore, but when you are designing, I mean, are there specific rules, things that do not really go together?

T: Now that is the marvel of that trade - that there is no rules. And that makes it also very complicated. It is not scientific, there is no alphabet, there are no rules. Not only there is no alphabet, there are no grammars, so you tell a story with words that you know, but there is no grammar.

L: Can we get lost though?

T: Yes, indeed. And I spend days being lost.

L: What do you do when you are lost?

T: Well, you do not even know you are lost. That is the thing - somebody else tells you: "Hey! What are you doing here? You are lost!"

L: What is the "Wasser touch"? Is there a "Wasser touch"?

T: Well, it is not for me to say because I do not know it. I mean, if there is, somebody else who knows my work would say: "Well, well, this is Wasser's" blah blah, but I do not know.

L: Do you know what people say about you though?

T: No.

L: You are not interested in that?

T: It is not that I am not interested, it is just that I do not know. I mean, people do not come out to you and say: "Oh well, you are this or you are that, and I love you for this". Sometimes, yes, "I love you for this and that", but basically you do not know what kind of image you project on people's mind.

L: So then, what are your tastes, I guess? What do you like?

T: I am very **versatile**, I mean, that is also maybe why it is difficult to eventually figure out the style. Because I change, I enjoy, I do not think too much. So, it is easy to get lost that way, but it is also very easy to **have different horizons**.

L: Of course. What is the most challenging of your perfumes up until now? What was, maybe, the perfume that gave you the most headaches? Or the most joy?

T: Joy… Every fragrance is a baby of yours, so it gives you joy. But indeed, there are times of labor which are more or less difficult.

L: Each pregnancy is different, yeah.

T: Indeed, I guess. I mean, how would I know, but yes. So, we are back to being lost. It is difficult when you have an idea, since there are no rules in what you are doing, to get to the point where what is physically in a bottle matches your idea. So, it can be years, and years, and years of trials and errors to get to that point where you are happy. And also - when do you stop? When are you happy? I mean a 100 percent happy, so happy from this piece of heart that you managed to create, alright? It is very difficult. Ask a painter, when, especially in abstract art - when is it over? When is it done? When are you happy? Here, it is the same thing. But fortunately, you have the business who tells you, you know, by May 15th, 2019, we have to launch that fragrance. So, obviously, it is like the painter again who says: "Well, there is a grand opening at a gallery, and I need to have some painting ready for that opening". So, it helps you to make or to take some decisions, but it is always difficult.

L: **We need deadlines**.

T: We all do. Otherwise, you can procrastinate, or you can find excuses, and you say: "It is just not cooked yet!" Well, come on.

L: In your personality, in the way you work, are you a loner, or you need to be with your team often? How do you work?

T: Both. The creative process is lonely. And Lord, my load is heavy! [laughs] I hate that, because it is not in my nature to enjoy today's loneliness. And you need an outside eye with a perspective to give you a sense of what you are doing, and eventually a horizon. If you are too much into what you are doing, you cannot see very far. And eventually, guess what? You get lost.

L: Yes, of course.

T: So, I have strong opinions. The **design is not a democracy**, at all. So, yes, it is lonely. But look - I am 58 and I started at age 21, so I have been around for a while. I am no spring chicken no more. And the older you grow, and you trade is your "it is", because more than anything, what helps you is your experience.

L: Of course.

T: And it becomes for me, strangely enough, easier and easier by the year, to express myself.

L: That is great! Thank you very much Thierry, and we will continue talking about creation and emotion in another episode.

#### TIFFANY & CO.
##### Fostering Creation & Design Through Innovation
*"Innovation is a fundamental asset for a successful company."*

Let us discover how an innovative spirit can foster creativity! **Dana Naberezny**, Chief Innovation Officer for Jewellery at **Tiffany & Co.**, unveils how the Maison **accelerates innovation** at the service of creativity and highlights the importance of having a diverse team.

My name is Dana Naberezny, and I am the Chief Innovation Officer of Jewellery at Tiffany & Co., as well as the Vice President of the Jewellery Design and Innovation Workshop. In this position, I work with our design, product and industrial teams to bring our new jewellery creations to life aided by an incredible team of:
- Engineers
- Computer-Aided Designers (CAD)
- Mastercraft people

###### Fostering Innovation AT TIFFANY & CO.
Innovation is a *fundamental asset* for a *successful company*. Let us focus on how, at Tiffany, we accelerate innovation higher and higher. Overall, you need to create:
- Environment
- Process
- Culture of trust and curiosity

Well, of course there are always happy accidents in innovation, especially if your team is perpetually curious. Many times there is a specific design to be achieved And a problem to solve. First, there needs to be an understanding of the goals. You can shatter some boundaries later, but it is important that this is done with intention and understanding.

Second is an understanding that there is no such thing as a bad idea or failure. Everything is an opportunity for learning. Every single idea is good because even if it just inspires another idea or makes people feel relaxed and comfortable, it works. For those who are new to it and trying to change that culture, it helps to have the highest person in the room throw out a *fantastical idea*, to make people comfortable with the *messiness of innovation*... that *no idea is bad*. 

Through everything, the key, though, is to encourage the team to throw out ideas early in the development process and create prototypes to test their hypotheses. The farther you get down *the process of development*, the more you are *wasting labor, materials* and even *emotional investment*. In our team, we even measure how often we kill a project and at what point in the process every month. A high percentage *of rejected ideas* is OK if it *happens early*. If it was later, why? Did we uncover something we could have figured out earlier?

The third part of accelerating innovation is the environment in which you are exchanging ideas. Typical spaces and meetings divide up specialties artificially. Mix it up. Create a space where you can be *flexible*, and people get out of their *comfort zones*. Leverage collaboration tools in a virtual and physical world that allow people to get their ideas out in different ways and test them. Digital tools have become so advanced, but at the same time, even a white board can be helpful.

Fourth is the way you prototype. What is the minimal amount you can show to quickly determine if an idea works or not? How can you give people the vision of what a product or process will look like? Innovation can also be quite efficient. Everyone likes to take in information differently. Resistance can sometimes just be confusion. Confusion that you can help by presenting an idea a few different ways.

###### Building THE RIGHT TEAM
The single most important tool you have in accelerating innovation, is the people you have in the room, virtual or physical. Everyone has a purpose and a reason for *being part of this process*. They have an expertise and need *to feel valued enough to share it*.

But though, the environment and process of innovation is important, ensuring you have a diverse team is critical. When I say diverse, I am saying it on a few levels. If everyone on the team looks the same and comes from the same background, your product will look the same. Your solutions will be the same, and you will not be able to make the critical change you need.

Not only do you need **diversity in**:
- Human makeup
- Skillset
- Proficiencies
- Thought
- Behavior
- Personality type

Project teams should be mixed from project to project, testing the balance and allowing new synergies to form. Taking advantage of successful learnings.

###### Technology MEETS CRAFT
One of the great sources of pride in the Jewellery Design and Innovation workshop is the work we have done on mechanisms. Icons like Knot and Lock. With lock the challenge was to create a mechanism that functioned similarly to a padlock without obstructing the beautiful, clean and bold lines of the piece. It is a unique shape, so we were challenged not only in the function, but in the form of a piece. And then, of course, the fit. It hugs the wrist.

Not only did this bracelet need to be inclusive with sizing from extra small to multiple extra larges, but the class needed to disappear into the peace and swivel in a sway that is similar to a padlock. And it needed to snap in place so the client could hear that click of security. It is magic. Plus, of course, we needed to make Lock in the most efficient way possible.

The research and development took over a year. We spent hours with our engineers and CAD designers and master craftspeople. We sat with designed to define the aesthetics and understand the critical aspects of the piece. Through it all, we made space for each voice.

We simulated function in CAD, parametrically modelling the pieces to ensure all the sizes were covered. *3D-printed prototypes* and *translated to metal* where a jeweler hand assembled more prototypes that I can count, ensuring *fit and function*. Ensuring that the piece could be made consistently and efficiently. And then we put the piece through rigorous quality testing that leveraged robotics as well as real life scenarios.

Then, the same team who brought it to life worked with the industrial team to ensure we could consistently achieve this innovation and the high standards that go along with it. CAD designers debated the smallest millimeter with each other. Craftspeople sat next to each other, leveraging techniques and their decades of experience.

This was not a project that was *100% done in a digital world*, this was not a project that was *100% done with only the hands of one jeweler*. It was a *complete partnership*. That technology amplified the craft and vice versa.

At Tiffany & Co. and at LVMH,
- Creativity: **a core value** shared by everyone
- We cherish the **innovative spirit** at every touchpoint
- Multiple levers to accelerate innovation: **work environment**, **culture**, **diversity of the teams** and the **advanced technologies** at our disposal

## LUXURY BRAND MANAGEMENT
### Brand DNA and Codes
Get a glimpse of Brand Management and the key stakes to ensure the success of a brand

*Let us begin with academic insights.*

#### The essence of a Luxury Brand
**Sonja Prokopec**, Professor of Luxury Brand Management at **ESSEC Business School**, uncovers why and how brands focus on building a strong brand identity, also known as 'Brand DNA'.

Hi, I am Sonja Prokopec, Professor of Luxury Brand Management at ESSEC Business School in Singapore. In this video, we will explore the essence of a luxury brand: its DNA.

In conventional marketing, brand management begins with *positioning*, differentiating a brand based on the *values* of *benefits* it offers in comparison to its competitors. For most businesses, positioning is foundational. However, luxury brands play by a different set of rules. Their focus is not comparative advantage, but inherent uniqueness. They do not compete within categories; they exist in a category of their own. Luxury brands have more akin to artists, each with a singular, recognizable identity evaluated on its own merits.

Instead of positioning, luxury branding name is anchored in the creation of a *strong*, *distinct*, and *enduring identity*: its brand DNA. For many luxury Maisons, the DNA is drawn from the brand's origin story and founder's vision. Yet this reliance on heritage can present a challenge, especially with the brand identity is heavily associated with its creator. The DNA must be *resilient*, capable of *withstanding generational shifts* and, importantly, the *absence of its founder*.

##### Christian Dior's DNA
Christian Dior exemplifies this. More than a designer, he reshape the post-war fashion landscape, in 1946, he established his Maison at 30 Avenue Montaigne, and in 1947, launch "The New Look": a silhouette marked by a cinched waist, full skirt, and elegant femininity. This audacious return to opulence in a time of austerity revitalize women's fashion and reaffirmed France's leadership in Haute Couture.

Through this creative act, Dior embedded a powerful set of values into the brand's DNA:
- French refinement
- Artistic daring
- Craftsmanship
- A commitment to beauty and joy

These pillars continue to guide the Maison today, reinterpreted by successive creative directors across collections, shows, and experiences. Despite Christian Dior's passing in 1957, the Maison has preserved and evolved its essence. Each creative chapter brings new expression. But the *underlying identity* remains *intact* and *recognizable* from the architectural lines of a jacket to the storytelling of a couture show.

Dior's brand DNA can be distilled into 5 key dimensions:
1. The man behind the myth: a revolutionary who redefined femininity and set the blueprint for modern luxury.
2. French Tradition & Heritage: deep cultural roots expressed through timeless style and savoir-faire.
3. Excellence: uncompromising standards in craftsmanship, service, and design.
4. Creativity: a bold, artistic spirit with a desire to innovate and remain culturally relevant.
5. Beauty & Happiness: an emotional mission to inspire joy, confidence, and dreams.
 
This DNA does not simply reside in product design. It extends to storytelling, visual identity, retail environments, and brand rituals, creating a coherent, immersive universe built on elegance and innovation.

##### Hennessy's DNA
Where Dior's DNA stems from aesthetic and culture vision of Mr. Christian Dior, Hennessy's DNA is value-driven. The brand has articulated its essence through four key commitments:
1. Hennessy dares to look beyond the horizon towards an uncompromising future.
2. Its unparalleled expertise in selection, maturation and blending makes the brand a master of potential.
3. Hennessy expertise creates magical experiences through sublime alchemy.
4. The Hennessy brand has travelled the globe, been embraced in every country and culture, and is therefore ease in the world.
Here, brand DNA functions not only as a legacy, but as a guide for future expression across categories and markets.

Ultimately, defining a luxury brand's DNA begins with a **deep understanding of identity**: who you are and what you stand for. It requires separating the brand from the ordinary, capturing its soul, and expressing that uniqueness with consistency and depth.

Once defined, the brand DNA must **be woven into every product, experience, and interaction**, from Haute Couture to fragrance, from physical spaces to digital storytelling. This consistency creates a rich and immersive brand universe stepped in heritage, vision, and emotional resonance.

And most importantly, a well-articulated DNA does not just communicate identity. It invites the customer into **the world of the brand**, allowing them to **dream, belong, and become part of a narrative** that is **timeless and inspirational**.

#### Great assets to build a brand
Let us stay with **Sonja Prokopec**, Professor of Luxury Brand Management at **ESSEC Business School**, to deep dive into **Brand Codes**, how they differ from the Brand DNA, as well as the **many forms** these can take.

Hi, I am Sonja Prokopec, Professor of Luxury Brand Management at ESSEC Business School in Singapore. In this video, we will discuss visual codes, the symbolic language of luxury brands. A luxury brand's DNA is made visible through a system of symbolic signals, commonly known as brand codes. These visual elements:
- Express **identity**
- Reinforce **heritage**
- Serve as a **silent language**

between the brand and its audience. 

##### Creating Nuanced VISUAL CODES
For much of the 20th century, luxury brands relied on what we now see as "loud" signals: prominent logos, monograms, and distinctive patterns. The Louis Vuitton LV and the Tiffany blue box are all examples of such overt codes. These signaled status and exclusivity to a broader public.

However, with the democratization of luxury and the rise of accessible luxury, these loud signals have become increasingly ever-present, and in some cases, diluted. Today's luxury consumers, while *valuing recognition*, often seek to *communicate status* in more *discreet ways*. They desire codes that are legible not to the masses, but to an initiated inner circle. Subtlety has become the new sophistication.

In response, many luxury Houses have shifted their focus toward developing refined, nuanced visual codes that are instantly recognizable to those in the know, while allowing the brand to maintain a rich identity across categories.

Subtle brand codes can take many forms. It can be a colour like Dior Gray, Tiffany Blue, or Veuve Clicquot Yellow, which serve as instantly recognizable cues. It can be animal motifs, like Bvlgari's Serpenti, Guerlain's bee, or Tiffany's bird on a rock. Shapes: like the distinctive shape of a Lady Dior bag, the Hennessy bottle silhouette, or Chaumet's tiara-inspired ring. Prints or patterns: Emilio Pucci's vibrant prints or the Anagram print of LOEWE. Materials and techniques: Cannage stitching on Dior leather goods or Scritto Calligraphy on Berluti leather products.

##### The Evolution of BRAND CODES
Unlike the brand DNA, which is deeply rooted and should not be changed abruptly, brand codes are adaptable. They evolve over time. A brand may choose to highlight certain codes, retire those that feel outdated, or introduce new ones based on archival inspiration and modern relevance. This *flexibility* enables *creative renewal* while reinforcing the *brand's distinctiveness*.

Dior provides a rich example of how historical context shapes visual codes. Christian Dior's upbringing in Granville, Normandy, surrounded by soft gray skies and pink blooms, inspired what would later become Dior's signature colour palette. His love of gardens, roses, and lilies is echoed in store interiors, packaging, and design details to this day.

The cannage stitching, seen across Dior bags and accessories, draws directly from the seats used during the Maison's first show in 1947. More than decoration, this stitching serves as a narrative thread, connecting the House's origin to its present. It has become a textural signature of Dior's design language, a discreet but powerful reference to its couture legacy.

Dior's codes extend into its architectural storytelling. From Avenue Montaigne in Paris to contemporary flagship spaces like the Gold House of Dior in Bangkok, interior design reflects the personal style and passions of Christian Dior and his sister Catherine. Architecture, inspired by Dior's early dream of becoming an architect, is increasingly positioned as a physical expression of the brand's visual identity.

##### What Makes A STRONG VISUAL CODE?
The most effective brand codes share two key characteristics. 
1. UNIQUE: They are instantly distinguishable and unmistakably tied to the brand, not merely to the category it competes in.
2. HERITAGE-BASED: They are anchored in the brand's DNA, often drawn from the  founder's vision, values, or key historical moments.

*Establishing a new code* requires *strategic, multi-channel* exposure. Take Bvlgari's Serpenti, for instance. Inspired by archival imagery of Elizabeth Taylor wearing a bespoke Serpenti bracelet during the filming of Cleopatra, Bvlgari reintroduced the motif across jewellery, watches, rings, and eventually, leather goods. Its prominence grew through consistent use in advertising, red carpet events, celebrity endorsements, and even serpentine-themed holiday installations at a flagship stores.

Today, the serpenti is not just a product line, it is a *symbolic extension* of Bvlgari's identity: *bold, mysterious, and unmistakably feminine*.

As luxury moves from overt to nuanced expression,
- Visual codes have become **vital tools** for **distinction** and **storytelling**.
- They allow brands to **maintain legacy** while **evolving their creative voice**.
- They serve as **silent ambassadors** of brand identity, connecting **past, present, and future** in a **single visual gesture**.

#### Product Superiority: An Asset for Branding
**Anne Michaut,** Marketing Professor at **HEC Paris**, reveals how some products' iconic features can become strong assets for branding.

Product superiority can originate from **multiple facets**: from raw material to craftsmanship to resulting comfort, refinement in design, etc. It is also essential to acknowledge that a luxury product aims at **reaching perfection**, but on **selected dimensions**. For instance, a watch may have an exceptional complication but be heavy, which could be seen as a disadvantage by some. A sports car will aim for performance in terms of speed, but may be perceived as noisy.

Let us now look at features of product superiority that became **so iconic to brands** to be perceived as **key elements of recognition** for brands today.

The most obvious one would be **exceptional design**. At Porsche, for instance, the Panamera or Cayenne models borrow design elements from the emblematic 911 as a way to establish proprietary "Porscheness" in different categories such as SUVs. The same goes for the Louis Vuitton's iconic trunk, whose exceptional design has been expressed in another category with the mini-trunk.

**Craftsmanship** at its finest can also become iconic in itself. For instance, the Berluti's patina that beautifies Berluti's shoes in a unique and proprietary way, allowing endless latitude for variety, provides Berluti with a signature, often copied but never equaled because of the authentic skills behind it.

**Exceptional raw material** can become iconic. Think about Loro Piana's reliance on the vicuna, which became almost proprietary to the brand thanks to their efforts in protecting this camelids species.

**Developing exceptional usage value** can also translate into iconic assets. Louis Vuitton's trunks are an excellent example of the exceptional usage value: the "library trunk" is designed for the **specific needs** of writers and bibliophiles, including Ernest Hemingway himself who got his ideal trunk designed with secret drawers and snug shelves. More generally, Louis Vuitton bags are designed for exceptional usage: for instance, the steamer bag is a small handbag designed to fit inside steamer trunks on boats.

Finally, **exceptional performance** can also ignite brand recognition. Louis Vuitton again, revolutionised luggage locks with a **unique and ingenious locking system** that transforms travel trunks into real treasure chests. The Vuitton lock is hence iconic of the brand, alongside the coated canvas which conveys lightness yet resistance to the bags.

In a nutshell, over time, **elements of product superiority**, proprietary to the brand, may become **iconic features** making its products **recognisable across categories**. They thus progressively become **key branding elements**.

#### Unveiling Branding Essentials
In this video, **Anne Michaut**, Marketing Professor at **HEC Paris**, explores the **five dimensions of luxury brand architecture**. Learn how luxury Maisons create and fulfill extraordinary desires, going beyond functional needs.

I am Anne Michaut, Professor of Marketing at HEC Paris, and we are going to talk about branding, a very essential topic, of course, in the luxury world. When addressing the topic of luxury branding, it is essential to keep in mind that it operates in a distinct territory beyond traditional branding principles. The fundamental distinction lies in its independence from necessity. Luxury Maisons must excel at *creating* and *fulfilling extraordinary desires*, rather than addressing functional needs. This distinction shapes both their purpose and their brand architecture.

The development of iconic brands goes beyond narrative creation. It requires a methodical process built on tangible foundations and reinforced through strategic actions over time. They express multiple dimensions of excellence beyond product characteristics and customer benefits. They must be brands of passion, sophistication and exclusivity. Luxury brand architecture rests upon five dimensions.

##### Heritage: Legitimacy, REINVENTION AND STRATEGIC VALUE
Heritage is more than history. It provides legitimacy and a unique foundation from which luxury brands can continually reinvent themselves while staying true to their essence. This proprietary origin serves as a strategic platform for creation, offering authentic storytelling opportunities that resonate with consumers across generations.

*Heritage management* is not just about *preserving the past*, it is about *evolving it*. It means turning a brand's rich history into a source of contemporary value, ensuring that tradition drives innovation rather than holding it back.

##### Vision: Strategic Consistency AND MARKET DIFFERENTIATION
A strong vision is the driving force behind the luxury brands strategic consistency, transforming funding principles into daily practice. It serves both as a strategic lighthouse, guiding long term ambitions and as an operational toolkit shaping what the brand creates and how it engages the market and how the organization functions.

This integrated approach ensures that luxury brands maintain strong coherence and a distinctive market position, creating a competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate.

##### Product Superiority, FUNCTIONAL VALUE & ULTIMATE PLEASURE IN USE
At the core of every luxury brand lies a commitment to excellence. The use of product superiority elements in branding is about transforming *specific aspects of craftsmanship or design* into *recognizable brand signatures* that transcend categories and time.

When consistently cultivated and protected, these elements evolve into powerful brand codes, telling a compelling story of authenticity and enduring value.

##### Experiential Superiority AND EMOTIONAL VALUE
Beyond exceptional products, luxury brands create immersive experiences that unlock deep emotional connections. The pursuit of emotional elevation drives them to explore new channels that transform product interactions into meaningful life experiences.

This emotional impact is most powerful when built on proprietary brand assets. Strengthening consumer bonds and setting the brand apart from its competitors.

##### Transformative Influence AND SYMBOLIC VALUE
Brand codes, ranging from signature elements to proprietary spaces, bring transformative influence and symbolic value to life. A luxury brand's social and cultural capital enables clients to express their identity through association. The branding journey culminates in symbolic recognition, where the brand becomes a statement of
- Status
- Purpose
- Belonging

However, building symbolic value goes beyond visual codes. It requires *educating customers* to attach *authentic meaning* to the brand universe. By combining consistent messaging and meaningful actions that reflect modern consciousness, brands create deeper, more lasting connections with their discerning audiences. Luxury is not limited to products or services, but rather it is about developing lifestyle enablers.

**To activate their full potential, iconic brands must:**
1. Inspire creation with a **proprietary recognizable signature**.
2. Express what/who the brand is through **elevating experiences**.
3. **Engage communities** and **connect** around the **Maison's values**.

### The Customer Journey
#### Moments and Decision Making: The Customer Journey
Understanding the decision-making path is crucial for creating meaningful brand experiences. **Anne Michaut**, Marketing Professor at **HEC Paris**, outlines the **five distinct stages of the customer journey**, from awareness to final purchase.

I am Anne Michaut, Marketing Professor at HEC Paris, and we are going to talk about experiences, but more specifically about customer journeys and experiences, which means that we are going to look at the objectives of these experiences. In our exploration of brand experiences, we turn our attention to a critical aspect of customer engagement: the decision-making path. Understanding how customers move from initial awareness to final purchase and beyond is crucial for creating meaningful brand experiences. The decision-making journey can be understood through five distinct steps.

##### Awareness
The first state is about creating awareness that extends beyond traditional target customers. This is where brands begin to establish their presence in the market. Press coverage, social media campaigns, and strategic events play a pivotal role in introducing the brand to a broader audience. The goal is not just to be seen, but to be *noticed* in a way that sparks *curiosity* and *initial interest*. For instance, luxury Maisons are hosting engaging exhibitions open-to-all and inviting broad audiences to understand not just their products, but their creative processes and core values, as well.

##### Interest
Once awareness is established, the focus shifts to generating genuine interest among potential customers. Websites become more than just digital storefronts. They transform into immersive experiences. User-generated content adds authenticity, allowing potential customers to see real experiences and connections with the brand. And events, of course, continue to play a crucial role, offering deeper insights and more engaging interactions that move beyond simple awareness.

##### Desire
At this stage, the brand must ignite a deeper emotional connection with authentic narratives. One-to-one interactions become particularly powerful, allowing brands to create personalized experiences that transform interest into genuine desire. The brand moves from being something known to something coveted.

Igniting desire requires a strategic segmentation of customers to target their specific aspirations in their experiences with the brand. Take music speakers for instance, some customers are drawn to technological innovation itself, while others seek emotional connection through music. These distinct customer profiles require fundamentally different approaches to igniting desire, recognizing that its origin varies across consumer segments.

##### Action
The action stage is where interest turns into purchase. More than a transaction, this moment is a *pivotal opportunity* to deepen *brand love* and forge *emotional connection*. Luxury brands elevate this experience through personalized touches. Careful wrapping or bespoke services contribute to a narrative of exclusivity and emotional investment. Buying a car, a watch or handbag becomes a memorable, almost ritualistic experience rather than just an acquisition. Each reinforces exclusivity, making the customer feel part of the brand's world turning customers into passionate brand advocates.

At this stage, brands must also build confidence in the decision. Seamless guidance, from guided pre-selection to AI-powered recommendations, helps customers make informed choices. The goal is to amplify desire while reducing uncertainty, ensuring the product feels like an aspirational, must-have object. The purchase moment, therefore, is more than a sale, it is a pivotal brand touchpoint that transforms customers into passionate advocates.

The purchase moment becomes a powerful touchpoint where brands can communicate their
- Values
- Creativity
- Emotional essence
transforming a commercial interaction into a deeply personal connection.

##### Post-Action
The journey does not end with the purchase; it evolves into deeper engagement and loyalty. Post-purchase experiences should:
- Enhance ownership pride
- Strengthen emotional ties

Luxury brands achieve this through exclusive events, workshops and curated experiences. Car brands invite customers to track days. Leather goods Maisons offer care and restoration workshops. These activities reinforce craftsmanship, exclusivity and belonging, as well as emotional attachment to their objects.

*Private previews*, *VIP gatherings*, and *masterclasses* keep customers *engaged*, turning *one-time buyers* into *lifelong brand ambassadors*.
- A seamless brand experience ensures **relevance and continuity**.
- Brands must **maintain excellence at every interaction**.
- The **decision-making** path is not linear but **dynamic**.
- Those that **succeed** turn transactions into **enduring relationships**.

### Strategic Collaborations
#### Strategic Collaborations in Luxury Brand Management
**Sonja Prokopec**, Professor of Luxury Brand Management at **ESSEC Business School**, dives into how and why brands develop **collaborations** and **curations**.

Hi, my name is Sonja Prokopec, and I am a Professor of Luxury Brand Management at ESSEC Business School in Singapore. In this video, we will deep dive into strategic collaborations in luxury brand management.

Luxury brands occupy a distinctive position in the business world. One that goes beyond functional utility to offer symbolic meaning, emotional resonance, and cultural relevance. Despite their storied heritage and aura of exclusivity, even the most iconic luxury brands cannot afford to remain static. In the face of evolving markets, shifting consumer expectations, and intensified global competition, strategic collaborations have become a *critical mechanism* for *maintaining relevance*, *expanding reach*, and *stimulating growth*.

##### Principles of LUXURY BRAND MANAGEMENT
To fully grasp the strategic significance of collaborations, it is essential to ground the discussion in the foundational principles of luxury brand management. Six core pillars underpin the success of any enduring luxury brand. **6 pillars**:
1. Position through uniqueness rather than comparison.
2. The cultivation of a strong, coherent brand DNA and visual codes.
3. The ability to construct and to communicate dreams through storytelling.
4. The continuous balancing of brand image with commercial growth.
5. Mastering over the paradox of time, honoring tradition while embracing innovation.
6. Maintaining control over integrated retail distribution to ensure consistency of brand image across all touchpoints.

These principles are not static. They must be continuously reinforced and adapted in response to external forces, particularly in the realms of culture, technology, and consumer behavior. This dynamic landscape is precisely where collaborations offer transformational potential.

Recent data highlights their importance. 76% of companies believe partnerships are crucial to achieving their revenue targets, and over half report deriving more than 20% of their revenue from existing alliances. Yet, in the luxury sector, the value of collaboration extends far beyond the financial outcomes. Collaborations offer an opportunity to reinvigorate *brand narratives*, access *new audiences*, enhance *cultural credibility* and innovate *product offerings*, all while maintaining the integrity of the brand's core identity.

##### Strategic Imperatives FOR COLLABORATION
For a collaboration to be successful, it must satisfy two strategic imperatives. The first one is the selection of the right partner for the right purpose. This requires clarity of intent, whether the goal is to reach a new demographic, enter a different cultural space, or enhance the brand's existing value proposition. Strategic partnerships may cross sectors, bridging luxury with art, gastronomy, or music, or occur within the same industry to consolidate cultural capital and expand influence.

The second imperative is execution. The partnership must be carried out with meticulous attention to brand alignment. Key elements of successful execution include the release of limited edition products to cultivate scarcity and desirability, the application of premium pricing strategies to reinforce perceived value, and a commitment to design excellence that is both aesthetically compelling and consistent with the brand's DNA. Above all, the collaboration must remain *faithful to the brand's core codes and identity*, even as it explores *new creative directions*.

##### RIMOWA as a Case Study FOR COLLABORATION
A compelling example of strategic collaboration can be found in the case of RIMOWA. RIMOWA has consistently partnered with a diverse array of collaborators, ranging from artists and fashion Maisons to musicians and cultural icons. With a dual object of
- Reaching **new audiences**
- Reframing the brand in **culturally relevant ways**

The collaboration of Off-White examplified this approach. It introduced RIMOWA to a younger, streetwear-conscious demographic, particularly among Gen Z and millennial consumers. Through the lens of Abloh's creative direction, RIMOWA bridged the gap between utilitarian travel gear and high fashion, injecting the brand with a sense of cultural cool.

Similarly, the RIMOWA x Dior partnership elevated the brand's positioning within Haute Couture, reinforcing its appeal among legacy luxury consumers and Dior loyalists. This collaboration emphasized
- Craftsmanship
- Exclusivity
- Aesthetic harmony
effectively aligning RIMOWA with the visual and experiential codes of couture House.

Executionally, RIMOWA maintains strict discipline. Most collaborations are launched as limited editions, fostering urgency, collectability, and cultural cachet. Pricing remains premium, ensuring alignment with luxury standards, even in collaborations that appeal to younger or street-oriented audiences. Importantly, even in highly stylized reinterpretations, such as the transparent suitcases developed with Off-White, the brand's core attributes of design, form, and craftsmanship remain intact. The result is a product that is *immediately recognizable* as RIMOWA, *regardless of creative embellishments*.

##### Strategic Collaborations BY DOM PÉRIGNON, LOUIS VUITTON & HENNESSY
Beyond the realm of travel goods, other LVMH brands have demonstrated similarly strategic use of collaboration. Dom Pérignon's "Queendom" campaign with Lady Gaga stands out as a bold intersection of luxury and performance art. The partnership featured *immersive storytelling* and *limited-edition sculptures*, marking not only a striking artistic endeavor but also Dom Pérignon's first collaboration with a female artist. Fittingly, one whose identity as a creator reflects the Maison's own DNA.

Louis Vuitton's collaboration with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama offers another masterclass in alignment. The campaign merged Kusama's iconic visual motifs with Vuitton's design language, uniting shared values of artistry, heritage, and global storytelling across product design, packaging, advertising, and retail experiences.

Hennessy has leveraged collaborations to assert cultural leadership and market differentiation. In the United States, the brand's partnerships with figures like Nas and organizations like the NBA have deepened its ties to contemporary cultural movements, particularly within African-American music and sports. These are not merely *marketing tactics*, they are strategic *expressions of brand identity*, reinforcing Hennessy's commitment to creativity, diversity, and global cultural influence.

### Luxury and the Creator Economy
#### Luxury Branding and the Creator Economy
**Emanuela Prandelli**, LVMH Associate Professor at **Bocconi University**, explores how brands can collaborate with **content creators** to resonate with younger audiences while maintaining brand control and considering new challenges.

Hello, I am Emanuela Prandelli and I have the privilege to be the LVMH Associate Professor of Fashion and Luxury Management, at Bocconi University. And today, it is my true pleasure to introduce you to the beautiful world of content creators in luxury.

While luxury brands were still finetuning how to collaborate at best with influencers, consumers began showing signs of fatigue, expressing small frustrations with the amount of sponsored content on social media. As a result, consumers started to turn their attention to a new wave of content creators, intended as native social media users generating authentic, often entertaining, content in close interaction with their communities.

Unlike influencers who rely heavily on brand collaborations and paid endorsements, creators rely more on direct transactions and tributes from their followers or fans. The main benefit for luxury is that they can infuse brands with a jolt of freshness that resonates especially with younger digitally native audiences. However, collaborating with them also raises new unexpected waves that luxury brands must learn to navigate, because creators are perceived as authentic just if they are let free to express themselves as artists do.

Hence, the main question becomes how brands can *balance control* with *creative freedom* and ensure that *collaborations* align with their *heritage and aesthetic*. Through a series of interviews to both luxury brand managers and creator economy stakeholders, we address two core challenges that luxury brands are facing in setting the right content creator ecosystem.
1. Brand control challenge: by understanding how to leverage the influence and creativity of these creators while still ensuring the brand's heritage, exclusivity and quality standards are preserved.
2. Brand innovation challenge: by exploring how content creators might support "semantic innovation" in luxury brand building.

Let us address them one by one.

##### Brand Control CHALLENGE
First, the brand control challenge. The brand control challenge requires the identify the "right does" of content that should come from the content creator ecosystem for a luxury brand. As we have already pointed out, in previous research, excessive engagement of consumers in new product development and too much freedom in customization can backfire in luxury.

What is the sweet spot for creator collaboration for high-end brands? How can creators help luxury brand building without risking the distinctive tone of voice? These questions point at *tension in luxury* between *monadic control* to preserve the *brand DNA* and openness to *stakeholder engagement*, a tension the creator economy makes stronger.

To incorporate creators as strategic partners in luxury branding, our evidence suggests that companies must set a clear creative perimeter with iron-clad briefing, but then they need to learn to relax control. Luxury brands are required to define somehow the core ingredients of a sort of "mystery box" that creators as chefs must use in their recipe, but then creators have to be let free to spice them up through their own original touch.

In other words, creator collaboration veers more towards relaxed creative control rather than classic luxury brand micromanagement. Once suitable creators have been identified, they should be trusted to "do their magic", to reinterpret the brand from their unique point of view. That is the reason why a brand partners with a specific content creator.

As a key information in our interviews said: you usually choose to sponsor *specific influencers* with the main goal of having them *talk to their fan base* about your product. Somehow, you buy their followers. When it comes to content creators, you buy, instead, their creativity.

Hence, managers should support creators by providing them with all the necessary resources to learn about the brand and its heritage, about what the brand stands for and what is not. And then let creators to "unleash" to do what they know best.

In this very delicate control balance, seeking exclusive partnerships with creators also seems to be a suboptimal strategy for luxury brands. Of course, luxury brands tend to avoid creators who have worked with either their direct competitors or also mass-market categories, to avoid negative dragging effects on brand positioning, but on top of that creators have to be respected as free agents, who should retain ownership of all collaborative content, while securing, of course, brands the rights to reuse it.

##### Brand Innovation CHALLENGE
And yet, we come to the second core challenge that luxury brands have to face in partnering with content creators, which is a brand innovation challenge. By leveraging the new technologies and digital content while preserving their core brand associations, chiefly their aura of exclusive craftsmanship.

In addition to technological innovation, content creators might support "semantic innovation" in luxury brand-building. As luxury brands have expanded the scope of their brand meanings from traditional concepts like heritage and timeless into concepts such as rebelliousness and innovation, the use of creators aligns with these newer and often transgressive meanings.

Our evidence highlights how the creators' *creative language* can *help innovate* the *same brand discourse*, especially if they are embodying the core values of specific sub-cultures. In other words, creators help unlock new brand meanings and values, by expanding traditional savoir-faire into a kind of digital savoir-faire. As creative artists, creators give brands new ways of conveying the artisanal spirit of luxury products.

To this goal, however, it is fundamental to make content creators live the brand experience, let them touch first-hand the brand craftsmanship activities, if you really want, they can properly reinterpret it through original digital content. As said into an LVMH Maison, you need to *identify talents* who are literally *obsessed by the production process*, more than by the product. Obsession for quality must be the mantra in content creation aiming at emphasizing craftsmanship.

In this vein, a key challenge is to resist the "hit and run" mentality. To innovate the brand language, collaborations with creators must span over a longer timeframe. As they are rooted into shared values and trusted relationships and the *credibility and authenticity* of content creators stem from their *embeddedness in communities* that are part of the greater creator culture, creator collaborations tend to be relatively long-term partnerships.

The brand might eventually first experiment with a short-term collaboration and then, when it works, decide to engage the content creator in a contract that goes much beyond a mere post, implying a broader underlying strategic partnership.

In brief, our investigation sheds light on how
- Collaboration with content creators and creative communities help luxury brands **embrace and communicate new meanings and values**.
- Creators inject **authenticity** and "**newness**", sometimes in **bold or transgressive ways**, making brands more **culturally relevant**.
- By engaging with **artistic subcultures**, luxury brands can **balance accessibility** while **preserving their aura** of exceptional **quality and desirability**.

Thank you so much for your time and for listening to this class about the very precious role that content creators are starting to play in the luxury industry.

## BRAND MANAGEMENT AT LVMH
### Importance of DNA with Bvlgari
#### A Crucial Starting Point in Building a Brand
**Jean-Christophe Babin,** CEO of **Bvlgari**, explains **the importance of a strong brand DNA** and compares it to the skeleton of an organisation, as it impacts every decision, from product development and communication, to the relationship with customers.

Hello, buongiorno. I am Jean-Christophe Babin, the Chief Executive Officer of Bulgari, and very happy to share with you today some considerations about brand DNAs and codes.

##### Brand *DNA*
Why is DNA so important for a company, for a brand? It is crucial as it will impact directly the organization, the talents, the product development, the communication, but also the retailing. So, it is really like a frame which is shaping each and very single decision you make.

##### About *Brand Positioning*
Bulgari is The Magnificent, Contemporary and Daring Roman High Jeweler, Master of Colours

Obviously, the first step is to make the DNA very explicit, very simple, and then, once you have done that, to share it across all the organization, to explain it, to diffuse it also throughout your partners' networks, with your suppliers. It is very important that your suppliers, for instance in gemstones, external designers, be fully involved and aware and understanding your DNA just because, as you expect from them proposals, obviously, providing them with an understanding of your DNA, an explicit one, you help them to frame some proposals which are much more likely to be consistent with your company that if they just create out of the blue.

##### Conveying *Brand DNA*
In a Bulgari store, you have to feel, compared to a competitor's store, the Roman spirit, the Roman dolce vita lifestyle. So, it is not only the decoration. It is very much about our people in the store. How do they welcome our clients? Not only "buongiorno", a few Italian keywords which immediately set you in a certain kind of context and environment, but also their hospitality. We talk very much, when you are Roman, about the Roman hospitality. It is war, it is cheerful, it is familiar. But on the other hand, selling high jewelry has to be sophisticated, educated.

So, we have to train also our people, whether they come from Japan, China, South Africa, but also the US, to behave, and somehow themselves to convey in the way they hook and connect with out clients, wherever they do it, in a way which is Italian or Roman. And in our trainings typically, there are a couple of days which are totally dedicated to "Romanity".

##### Bulgari *Icons*
Bulgari is not only a jeweler. We are also a watchmaker. We are a fragrance maker. We have hotels. We have fashion leather goods. So, DNA for us is really crucial to drive creativity across categories and not only for jewelry. We see through those several examples that from this magnificent Roman DNA, today we are expressing the DNA through a code the snake. And that code, thanks to the DNA, has been expressed by each and every single division into a successful product line.

That said, we should not consider the DNA as a constraining frame. It is an inspiring frame, but it leaves obviously a lot of room to creativity.

##### Communicating *Brand DNA to Clients*
Diffusing the DNA is also extremely important to the final client. We have a lot of different ways of communicating nowadays. And from the social network to the traditional communication, from the CRM activities to the one-to-one, the DNA as well is totally influencing the style, the substance, the keywords.

So, when I said "Roman", when I said "magnificent", when I said "contemporary", if you are contacted in CRM, our staff will immediately use those words. So, they are kind of a Bulgari world opener to our clients. And overtime, because it is not something that works in 3 months, over a few years, they become some signs which immediately will connect you to your clients, to your partners, to your retailers, to your colleagues in the company. So, it is a shortcut and it is like really an internal language. And in that, you have obviously to be explicit, to be consistent and to really build it overtime in your trainings, in all your communications.

##### My Role as *Bulgari CEO*
Bulgari is really larger than life, and surely much larger than its CEO, fortunately. And therefore, myself as a CEO, I am not Roman, I am French. I am not magnificent. I do not pretend to be. And I am less and less contemporary as age is increasing.

So, how am I myself an ambassador? How do I convey the Bulgari DNA messages? I think it is very much about diving deep inside the history, the heritage, the culture, the style, the environment. I mean, 2,700 years of architecture, of arts, the lifestyle, the dolca vita which is obviously fascinating, but also contemporary Roma, still a very active, energetic, joyful city. And integrating all those elements. Obviously, in the case of Roma, it is pretty easy as Roma is *the* city. It compels you to become really an ambassador of that DNA.

##### Quiz
In Bvlgari Stores, you have to feel the Roman Spirit, the Roman dolce vita lifestyle, from decoration to hospitality...
- [x] True
- [ ] False

### Brand Management in Perfumes & Cosmetics
#### Discover Brand Management at Parfums Christian Dior
Join **Nina Cooper**, International Marketing Director for the Makeup Category at **Parfums Christian Dior,** as she unveils her role, from defining the strategy and positioning of the Makeup category, to building strong innovation plans and omnichannel activations.

I am Nina Cooper, currently International Marketing Director for the Makeup Category at Parfums Christian Dior. I started my journey at LVMH as an intern more than 10 years ago in the exact same PCD makeup team. Right after my internship, I wanted to move abroad, and I found my first job in London where I worked for a top beauty player to develop their cosmetic franchise. After 4 years there, I had the amazing opportunity to come back to Parfums Christian Dior and join the international makeup team as product manager.

##### Key Roles *as Marketing Director*
Being an international marketing director means that you navigate through a wide variety of touchpoints and everyday feels different from another. The most important part of your job is to define the global strategy of your category. Each category, fragrance, makeup, or skincare, has a different purpose for the brand, but all of them need to be in line with the brand DNA in its expression.

Once the strategy is established, you work the category positioning and long-term image within the Brand while in parallel creating a product innovation plan. You define the identity of your category through the campaigns and the storytelling but also through the packaging and formulas. For this part we work in close collaboration with Peter Philips, our Creative and Image Director.

Then, we also study our consumer to work a *tailor-made* omnichannel activation plan for each launch to make sure we hit them at the right moment of the purchasing journey. We lead the entire 360 activation: on and offline media campaign, merchandising, training, sampling, CRM. And of course, we do it at a global level but we driven and design centrally all operational aspects for the key countries.

This is a big part of the job of course but another big one goes with managing and monitoring the top-line and bottom-line growth of your category, the market share performances, profitability and complexity.

##### Brand Management *at Parfums Christian Dior*
Brand management for me means working on two main pillars. The first one is to define the brand DNA: Which core values does your brand stand for? What messages, what story do you want to convey when people think about your brand. This is fundamental to work on the brand mission because by definition it is what will build its long-term desirability and also how your brand will stand out from all the others.

The second one, is to get to know as much as possible who is your client to better talk to them about your brand in a way that feels authentic. In the cosmetic field, the competition is quite ruthless and new brands are launched everyday but a lot of them die in the two to five years of their launch because they did not manage to keep a strong link with their client across time. They did not manage to keep the conversation going between them and their clients.

The main challenge of brand management for an international label like Dior is to stay relevant *locally* while conveying your *global* brand image. And this is where an omnichannel approach based on customer centricity makes sense: you keep the global brand image but adapt it to the different way of consuming assets on the different local ecosystems to stay relevant and to maintain this conversation with the client.

##### The Main Challenges *in the Beauty Industry*
There are many challenges we facing in the beauty industry and one of the most important of them is for me the *omnichannel approach*. Beauty and especially makeup, has been for the past decades all about trying the products in store and having a great Brick and Mortar exposure, podiums, big counters in the hottest spot of the department store. Now, and especially since COVID, e-commerce is sometimes the biggest distribution channel.

Our customer is in need of a privileged online experience that feels as good as the offline one. And it becomes even more challenging when you cannot control everything with e-retailers for example. If you take the example of China, there is a multiplication of e-commerce platforms and each of those have a specific customer journey, different target, different assets to play.

That said it does not mean that our customers are not looking for unbelievable and never seen before multisensorial and immersive experiences. This is where the omnichannel approach is more important than ever. You need to understand how your clients shop and on which touch point you will better engage with them. Basically, it means that you need to talk to your different customers through various channels, that each have different ways of working, but in the end, conveying the same message. It is a true challenge!

##### Key Pillars *to Develop Brand Desirability*
Nowadays customers do not expect from a global brand like Dior to only have a beautiful packaging, institutional campaigns and the biggest shows ever. They need to feel that they are sharing the *same values* as your brand. We know that for every customer but it is even more true for the younger crowds, the one that we need to recruit to stay relevant across time.

When you are one of the beauty leading brands, I strongly believe that values like sustainability, inclusivity and female empowerment and true must-haves to defend but you need to find your own way of doing it. A way that feels authentic to your core values and heritage. Actually, I think there is nothing worse than a brand trying to tick all the boxes but with no real commitment!

*Sustainability* is a matter of eco-design but also an everyday approach in asset creation for example or the merchandising materials you choose. This is encapsulated in our *beauty as a legacy* brand statement. For diversity and inclusivity, it needs to show and irradiate not only on every asset and campaign of the brand but also in the product offer. For a very long time, we could not offer a perfect foundation matching to our clients, but since 2022 in the Forever range we offer *43 shades* to match all skin tones and all skin types. This is what inclusivity and diversity means.

##### Conclusion
To conclude, I would say that working on a daily basis on the makeup category of Parfums Christian Dior is a matter of passion. The passion to write the story of the category and its iconic franchises like Rouge Dior, Dior Addict and Forever within the global brand architecture. The passion to make the category shine globally while being more desirable than ever.

The last words for this course are from Christian Dior, who said himself: Whatever you do in life, do it with *passion*.

#### Operational Brand Management at Kenzo Parfums
Let us now focus on another marketing role to establish desirable brands: local operational brand management.

Before moving to a new role as France Marketing Director at Parfums Christian Dior, **Laure Corvaisier** was Marketing Director at Kenzo Parfums France. She discusses about her experience **driving the brand strategy** within the French market.

My job consists in driving the fragrance strategy for the French markets. Meaning trying to execute as is best the launch plan for the fragrances and also to carefully monitor my investments in trade, media, BCs (Beauty Consultants), training.

##### Can you give me an example *of the campaigns you run*?
At Kenzo, it is really a test-and-learn House. That is why this year, we create the Fête du Printemps for our pillar Flower by Kenzo. La Fête du Printemps celebrates the first day of spring. For that special occasion, we distribute perfume poppies in the streets, create very storytelling advertorial in magazines and put poppies everywhere within the Sephora store thanks to a very exclusive partnership.

##### What is it like *to work at LVMH*?
Working for LVMH means working for a very powerful and leading group in the luxury industry, because we have a lot of means to facilitate our day-to-day work. For example, when I was working in marketing development at Guerlain and briefing the laboratories, all the laboratory are synergetic, meaning that you get the best texture, the best innovations, and that you can face the competition. Another point is that you can share with all Maisons a lot of data. Customer knowledge, customer studies, and it is really important to know perfectly your clients.

##### Any advice *for future talents at LVMH*?
My advice to the students that want to start a career in the Group is to dare. Dare to create your own network and to meet inspirational people. And finally, when you will join the Group, dare to give your a point of view, dare to be innovative and creative because this is something that really will make the difference within your career.

### Brand Management in Wines and Spirits
#### Brand Management at Veuve Clicquot
**Carole Bildé**, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at **Veuve Clicquot**, talks about how to make a brand the most desirable one, especially in the Wines and Spirits sector.

In this video, you will learn more about the 4 key pillars to have a clear brand management vision: **identity, legacy, culture and commitment**.

My name is Carole Bildé. I joined the Group in 2018, after spending 4 years at Chloé as the Global Brand Strategy and Communication Director where I also had the chance to build and successfully launch the first Chloé e-commerce. I previously spent 15 years in advertising, first at ogilvy then at BETC, Havas Group. 15 years during which I experienced the power of strong brands and inspiring creation. I have been the Chief Marketing and Communications Officer of Veuve Clicquot since 2018. Beyond the renowned Champagne brand, I have discovered a luxury Maison with a wonderful history of savoir-faire, innovation and a unique legacy dedicated to empowering women. My role is to *engage people* into this journey and make Veuve Clicquot the most *desirable luxury brand* beyond the champagne category.

##### Brand Management VISION
How to be the most desirable brand should be our obsession. It is all about desire. That is my brand management vision. When you take care of a brand that is 250 years old, it is a complex equation. You have to be very clear about who you are, where you come from, and then build upon its solid foundations. Sometimes, when you have such history, you might be tempted to believe that everybody knows and that you have to focus on novelty to build excitement. It is not enough.

You need to give depth and purpose, express it clearly and loudly and bring concrete proof of it. No matter how old you are. You have to be very clear on the role you play in your category, and more widely in the Luxury space. I like to ask the question: What would the world miss if your brand suddenly disappeared? It appears very simple at first but calls for serious work on purging and making choices.

Starting with identity. Veuve Clicquot has this chance to play in the league of the rare brands who have an iconic colour. This Clicquot yellow is an amazing asset, when you enter a shop you recognize it immediately, and given the fact that we are a wholesale business, this is key. But beyond recognition, what does this yellow stand for? Our Clicquot yellow, present on our bottle labels since 1877, is the colour of the rising sun: it is an ode to energy, audacity, and to the profound conviction that each new day offers fresh possibilities, a legacy of Madame Clicquot's optimism. As you can see, yellow has more depth than just being a colour.

Which brings us to the question of legacy. Strong brands usually have a founding myth in their history. One which is defining the whole journey. Ours is called Madame Clicquot. She was not the founder of the company, yet everything started with her when in 1805 she took the reins of the Maison after the death of her husband. She was 27, she had a little girl, and at this time, women did not have the right to work or even hold a bank account. However, she revolutionized the sector through major innovations. She had to face numerous obstacles before she was respected and ultimately named "La Grande Dame" of Champagne. Our story is one of boldness, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.

And then, we turn legacy into culture. In 2022, we celebrate our 250th anniversary. A marker in time, a unique moment of dialogue between past and present, for which we decided to highlight 250 years of *audacity* and *entrepreneurship*. A solaire culture of joy and optimism, shared through an ambitious, immersive, traveling exhibition a deep dive into the heritage, savoir-faire and cultural imprint from 1772 to the present day. 10 women artists were commissioned to celebrate Madame Clicquot's remarkable achievements and offered their contemporary vision of a 19th century influencer who paved the way for generations of female entrepreneurs. The exhibition traveled to Tokyo, Los Angeles and London and was called "Solaire Culture", of course!

And finally, culture becomes commitment. Brand management in luxury is indisputably linked to the question of commitment. A luxury brand has to be *a committed House*. Commitment has to be sincere; it has to be linked to who you are and to what you believe in, but not because you are forced into it. If your commitment is not sincere, people will see it immediately, and that is worse than not seeing anything at all. Commitment also has *to be concrete*, it has *to have facts*. It cannot just be pretty words in powerpoint presentations.

Our commitment is to bring our active support to female entrepreneurs around the world since 1972, 50 years. So far, we have honored more than 450 female entrepreneurs in 27 countries with our Bold Woman Award and we have now extended the program to Bold conversations, Bold podcasts and mentoring sessions, to name a few. Our obsession with our Bold program is to gain impact with our actions and push boundaries.

##### Identity, Codes AND EXPERIENCES
There are three ways to master and control Veuve Clicquot identity, codes and experience when there is almost no retail. One of the key challenges we have in the Wines and Spirits sector is that we have almost no retail which means no direct control of merchandising, of the customer experience, of the brand speech. The search for coherence is a real challenge when you are unable to control all the channels.

The question then becomes: how do you build a consistent experience? We do not expect all countries to have the same execution we have set-up a glocal strategy with 50% content being produced centrally and 50% being produced locally for local relevancy but never compromising the message we communicate. There is only one brand idea, with one common history and legacy, and common codes. I would like people to be surprised by the richness and diversity of executions when in contact with the brand, but I do not expect them to reconciliate the stories; the brand idea and platform have to be 100% crystal clear. Having a bold and simple message helps to address such a challenge, having all markets embrace it. Simply said: Veuve Clicquot is Solaire an invitation to dream big, bright and beautiful.

Creativity has to play a *central role* in luxury brand management. For a champagne brand, this question is not an easy one since you cannot easily play with the product itself. Considering that you have a minimum of 3 years ageing in our cellars before proposing your product on shelves and it is a minimum you have to consider other options. Packaging, for instance. The story of Veuve Clicquot is made of stunning collaborations with renowned designers, who have created amazing bespoke objects for us - Andrée Putman, the Campana Brothers, Mathieu Lehanneur, Karim Rashid and Yayoi Kusama. The story started in 2006 when Yayoi Kusama did a masterpiece of Madame Clicquot's portrait. For the launch of our vintage 2012 Prestige cuvée "La Grande Dame", she accepted to design the case and the bottle using her iconic symbols, flowers and polka dots. A joyous flower wraps around La Grande Dame bottle, and this same symbol of energy - a tribute to the nature that both Madame Clicquot and Yayoi Kusama hold dear also takes shape as a special object that elevates La Grande Dame cuvée in magnum.

Through this outstanding creation, through the poem the artist wrote for us, we have done more than design a product, we have spread a message of hope and optimism to the world. It is all about giving a *purpose* and some *depth* and people have welcomed this universal message with great enthusiasm.

The main ingredient for the success of a brand today, is to *reinforce your fundamentals*. The stronger the brand, the better we will withstand our category's economic fluctuations.
- Do **less but better**
- Craft more **desirable products**
- Bring more **exclusivity on products and experiences**
Loudly claim who you are and what you stand for. Simply, but loudly. Our platform stands in one word: Solaire!

### Brand Management in Jewelry
#### Branding Strategy at Tiffany and Co.
As you previously saw, **branding is key** in order to create a distinct and unique identity for a Maison in the minds of consumers.

Watch this video from **Sage Klapper**, Global Marketing Director at **Tiffany and Co.**, and learn more about the Maison's "**Inspire, Elevate, and Educate**" **framework** used to develop their branding strategy.

My name is Sage Klapper, and I am a global Marketing director at Tiffany and Co. I have been in the global marketing organization here for about nine years now. My core responsibility is to oversee the development and deployment of our 360 communications strategy worldwide, and my focus area is our jewelry icons, such as Tiffany Lock and Tiffany T.

Since our founding in 1837, we have been a brand rooted in love. Weather designing a pearl necklace and earrings for President Abraham Lincoln to gift his wife in 1862, or introducing the Tiffany setting engagement ring as the universal symbol of unending love in 1886, we have dedicated ourselves to mastering the *craft excellence and expertise* to express love through a history of *iconic collections*. We have created a portfolio of imaginative motifs, ideas and emblems synonymous with love, which has endured across generations.

As the world evolves and the definition of love expands, so have we. On the global marketing team, we are constantly challenging ourselves to develop initiatives that express an inclusive and relevant take on love, while staying true to our rich heritage. We understand that love is like a diamond, *complex* and *multi-faceted*. It changes with *each person and their story*, and with *each society and its history*. We work closely with our regional counterparts to ensure we are delivering campaigns that will resonate in their local countries, making sure we respect the many cultures and traditions that make up our world.

##### Brand EXPRESSION
The expression of the brand lives way beyond a magazine advertisement. In order to deliver a clear message to clients and consumers, *synchronization* and *close partnership* across functions is *essential*. We work with so many teams to bring in initiative to life, from the website to visual merchandising, employee training, PR and category management, just to name a few. Whether a client walks into one of our stores, an employee catching up on their latest training module, or a consumer sees one of our Instagram posts, they should all be able to easily understand that Tiffany and its amazing collections stand for the many facets of love.

##### Branding STRATEGY
I will give you a quick strategy crash course that shows how all of these factors come to life. When working on an initiative, a helpful framework that we use to develop our strategy is inspire, elevate and educate.

First is inspire. As a nearly 200 year old brand, you can imagine the number of stories we can tell. We bring *archival storytelling* into our initiatives to *inspire and delight our clients* in a way that only Tiffany can. This can manifest in a number of ways. We might have advertising copy that speaks directly to an archival story, internal training materials that show 100 year old Tiffany piece that inspired a new design today, an exhibition in one of our international markets that showcases the history of the Maison, or a vintage New York Times ad posted on our Instagram just before Valentine's Day.

Next is elevate. Elevate means always making our product the hero. Our products are expressions of love. From our rigorous diamond sourcing process to our global jewelry workshops, and our legacy and colour gemstones, the craft and discipline that goes into the design and production of each Tiffany piece is unparalleled. In advertising, heroing product can mean shooting very detailed images, which show the intricate and amazing details of each piece, or developing craft content that shows a behind the scenes look of how the jewelry is made.

Elevating and heroing a product might be the most important strategic pillar when it comes to cross-functional efforts. When elevating a certain collection in advertising, or website and store experience should drive the same level of allure for that product. While our beautiful product can certainly speak for itself when you see it in person, online descriptions, consistent merchandising strategies, and talking points for client advisors, help to ensure that clients and consumers truly understand the Tiffany difference when it comes to design and craft.

Last but not least, is educate. Wearing jewelry is a very intimate and meaningful experience. Our goal is to educate clients and consumers about how *each of our collections* symbolize *expressions of love* In our recent campaign called, "With love, since 1837" our advertising feature copy that clearly stated what each collection symbolized. Personification is another way that you can drive meaning, and partnering with celebrities and creators to dress them in pieces that feel authentic and showcase their style helps to educate and storytell.

As you can see, there is no shortage of ways to bring the DNA of our Maison and the story of our collections to life. In global marketing, it is our job to develop the **framework** like the one we just reviewed, for example, to set an initiative on a clear path. But success would not be possible without the **collaboration**, **creativity** and **hard work** that comes from our cross-functional partners, both here in New York and in our regions. It is truly an honor to sit in this role and add to the legacy of this amazing Maison, **moving it forward** and **driving relevance** while still **honoring the past**.
